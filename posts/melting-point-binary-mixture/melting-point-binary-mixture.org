Solid mixtures have important "real-world" applications. Mixtures of lead and
tin are used as solder to make jewelry, to connect copper pipes for plumbing,
or to connect electronics components to circuit boards. Solid mixtures have
interesting properties that were studied by early physical chemists, who then
developed equations and theories that describe and predict the behavior of
mixtures. In this experiment we will probe mixtures of fatty acids, which are
non-toxic and commonly found in soaps.

** Learning objectives {#learning-objectives}
*** Process Objectives
Develop the ability to convert a relationship into a linear form and apply that relationship, demonstrating the ability to
 - linearize a relationship.
 - identify the dependent and independent variables in a linear relation and relate these variables to measurable quantities in the lab.
 - locate the desired properties from a linearized, graphed relationship
    using the slope and intercept.

*** Content Objectives
Choose experimental parameters that allow determination of the phase diagram of a mixture of solids demonstrating the ability to
- predict the freezing point of a mixture
- connect the freezing points of mixtures of solid A with solid B added as the solute to mixtures of solid B with solid A added as the solute
- define and label the components of a solid-liquid phase diagram, including the eutectic point.
