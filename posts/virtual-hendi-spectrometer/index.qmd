This virtual Helium NanoDroplet Isolation (HeNDI) spectrometer simulates the infrared spectra of OCS molecules in liquid helium droplets. The low temperature of the droplets makes for simplified spectra in comparison to the gas phase, and analysis of the rotationally resolved monomer band makes for interesting activities in molecular spectroscopy.

Objectives of a tested exercise that uses the virtual spectrometer are to:

-   Collect simulated infrared spectra of OCS solvated in liquid helium, and perform a rovibrational analysis of the monomer P- and R-branches (2061-2062 wavenumbers).

-   Determine the moment of inertia of helium that is coupled to OCS by comparing the helium solvated and gas phase rotational constants.

-   After determining the intensity of each P- and R-branch peak, calculate the rotational temperature of the droplets.
