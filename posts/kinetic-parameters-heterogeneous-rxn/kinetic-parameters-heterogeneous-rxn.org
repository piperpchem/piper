* What is this experiment about?
Students extend prior experience with chemical kinetics to the
heterogeneous process of the oxidation of solid magnesium by dilute
hydrochloric acid. Experimental design is a major component of the
experiment. Students first do exploratory experiments to evaluate the
measurable property and the form of solid magnesium they should
use. Students then obtain rate data and calculate kinetics
parameters. In the final cycle, students determine the activation
energy.
* What do students do?
In the first cycle, students react several forms of solid magnesium with dilute
hydrochloric acid and measure the initial rate of hydrogen gas production. Data
analysis helps identify the measurable property of magnesium that determines
the reaction rate. They then choose the form of magnesium they should use for
the remainder of the experiment. The second cycle introduces the rate law for the
experiment. Students perform multiple kinetics runs varying the appropriate
measurable properties of the solid magnesium and the dilute hydrochloric acid.
Questions guide students in determining the kinetics parameters. A final cycle has students review the
Arrhenius equation and design and perform experiments to evaluate the activation energy.
* What equipment and supplies will you need?
- Solid magnesium (required: ribbon; at least one of: powder, turnings, rod)
- 1M HCl(aq) that students can dilute for use in their experiments
- Gas pressure sensor, such as from Vernier
- Constant temperature bath (room temperature to 45°C is sufficient)
- 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask as the reaction vessel, volumetric glassware, balances, thermometers
* What makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?
The experiment illustrates how physical chemists make decisions about
experiment parameters to obtain reliable results and build models for
chemical behavior. Students first apply previous kinetics concepts to
heterogeneous systems, making choices about forms of solid magnesium
to use based on analysis of exploratory experiments. Once they have
the rate law and kinetics parameters, they connect those to the
Arrhenius equation that can describe the temperature dependence of the
reaction rate.
* And what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?
Students begin with experiment design, discussing the measurable
properties that can affect reaction rate and making decisions about
running experiments to explore those properties. They make predictions
about how reactant properties or external conditions, such as
temperature, affect reaction rates. In order to explore the possible
parameters, including forms of solid magnesium, students share data
and interact with their peers to obtain reliable results and
conclusions. Students use graphical representations (initial rate
determination) and mathematical models (the Arrhenius equation) in
drawing conclusions.
