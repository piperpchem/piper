As 2025 approaches, we are on the cusp of making some major decisions about our discipline, its future, and our focus in thinking about students’ learning and our teaching. 
This meeting intends to act as a prompt to draw on the latest research and scholarly activity to help us address the future paths where our discipline is headed. The conference will focus specifically on pertinent themes relating to the above, with invited talks and participant posters aligning to one or more of the following:

-   Methodological approaches to exploring student understanding and reasoning
-   Reforming teaching approaches for a new era of chemistry education
-   Refocusing on the role of laboratory teaching
-   Individualized learning experiences and the role of artificial intelligence in supporting student learning
-   Digital affordances in learning and teaching chemistry
-   Epistemology in chemistry
-   Global perspectives in chemistry education: sustainability, accessibility, and interdisciplinarity

The 29th BCCE will be held on the lakeside campus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the Summer of 2026. The conference, like all of its predecessors, provides the chemistry education community with opportunities to interact and engage. The conference will be a mixture of symposia, workshops, poster sessions, exhibits, and spaces for both formal and informal conversations.

All chemistry educators are invited to contribute to the conference by submitting a program proposal (opens August 1, 2025), or abstracts for presentations. You do not have to present in order to attend the BCCE. Also, you do not have to be a member of the American Chemical Society or the ACS Division of Chemical Education to attend or present at the BCCE.
