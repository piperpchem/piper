# Berger quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics/kinetics course materials 

These course materials were designed by [Rob
Berger](mailto:bergerr@wwu.edu) for flipped-classroom implementation of
undergraduate quantum chemistry course at Western Washington University.

## Implementation

Rob covers quantum for \~11 weeks and stat/mech thermo for \~9 weeks,
combining for two 10-week quarters. Students take quantum first, so the
stat mech coverage assumes some familiarity with quantum models. (There
is also a third quarter of p-chem at WWU that mainly covers equilibrium
and kinetics, but Robâ€™s materials for that course are not yet as
extensive.)

Typically, Rob assigns students to watch about two videos per week,
depending how content-rich the videos are. In class, there is usually a
brief recap of key points in each video with opportunities for students
to ask questions, followed by in-class group problem-solving activities
or the above computer simulation activities. The in-class problem sets
are not included here, but Rob would be happy to discuss and/or share
those, too.
