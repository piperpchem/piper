A 14-item, multiple-choice diagnostic assessment tool, the quantum
chemistry concept inventory or QCCI, is presented. Items were
developed based on published student misconceptions and content
coverage and then piloted and used in advanced physical chemistry
undergraduate courses. In addition to the instrument itself, data from
both a pretest, prior to a semester of instruction, and a post-test,
after a semester of instruction, are provided. These data suggest that
the QCCI is capable of measuring the variation of student conceptual
understanding of quantum mechanics in the context of a physical
chemistry course and that the instrument is sensitive to gains in
student understanding that result from direct instruction in the
topic, even when that instruction has a significant mathematical
component as is common for this course.
