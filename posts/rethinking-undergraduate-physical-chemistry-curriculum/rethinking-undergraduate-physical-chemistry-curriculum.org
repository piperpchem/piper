A summary of fundamental changes made to the undergraduate physical chemistry curriculum in the Chemistry Department at Gustavus Adolphus College (beginning in the 2013-2014 academic year) is presented. The year-long sequence now consists of an introductory semester covering both quantum mechanics and thermodynamics/kinetics, followed by a second semester that covers more advanced and integrated topics. While the initial rationale for changing the physical chemistry sequence was to improve the department’s overall curriculum, the process has raised some important questions about the propriety of the traditional approach to physical chemistry education in the 21st century.

Excerpt of changes to topics covered:
