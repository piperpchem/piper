In the first part of the experiment, students familiarize themselves with model fitting.

Have students rationalize which equation of state best models the pressure–volume relationship of a real gas utilizing statistical arguments\n2.  Familiarize students with the open-sourced statistical package R\n3.  Familiarize students with multivariable regressions\n4.  Familiarize students with statistical information for model selection\n5.  Determine values for the second virial coefficient of ambient air\n\n\n\nJonathan P. Antle, Jerry T.
