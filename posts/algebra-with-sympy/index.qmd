This tool defines relations that all high school and college students would recognize as mathematical equations. They consist of a left hand side (lhs) and a right hand side (rhs) connected by the relation operator "=". This tool applies operations to both sides of the equation simultaneously, just as students are taught to do when attempting to isolate (solve for) a variable. Thus the statement Equation/b yields a new equation Equation.lhs/b = Equation.rhs/b The intent is to allow using the mathematical tools in SymPy to rearrange equations and perform algebra in a stepwise fashion using as close to standard mathematical notation as possible. In this way more people can successfully perform algebraic rearrangements without stumbling over missed details such as a negative sign.
