The goal of TMP Chem is to provide free, high-quality physical chemistry study resources to anyone, anywhere.

Quantum Chemistry and Spectroscopy and Chemical Thermodynamics and Kinetics are both complete. Theoretical and Computational Chemistry in progress.

Physical chemistry is the use of physics to develop descriptive mathematical models for the behavior of chemical systems. Physical chemistry is typically studied for 2-3 semesters by university chemistry students. Prerequisites includes general chemistry, general physics, algebra, and calculus.
