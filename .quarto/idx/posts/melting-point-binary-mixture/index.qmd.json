linear form and apply that relationship, demonstrating the ability to\n\n-   linearize a relationship.\n-   identify the dependent and independent variables in a linear relation and\n    relate these variables to measurable quantities in the lab.\n-   locate the desired properties from a linearized, graphed relationship\n    using the slope and intercept.\n\n\n### Content Objectives {#content-objectives}\n\nChoose experimental parameters that allow determination of the phase diagram of a mixture of solids demonstrating the ability to\n\n-   predict the freezing point of a mixture\n-   connect the freezing points of mixtures of solid A with solid B added as the solute to mixtures of solid B with solid A added as the solute\n-   define and label the components of a solid-liquid phase diagram, including the eutectic point.\n\n\n## Location {#location}\n\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9eKUY5kLiYoUEF5a1FVY1NJRDg/view?usp=sharing>\n\nInstructor's handbook
