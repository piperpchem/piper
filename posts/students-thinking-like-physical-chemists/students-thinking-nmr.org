A revised version of a traditional physical chemistry laboratory
experiment has been developed to enhance student discussion in the
laboratory and to improve students’ connections between physical
chemistry concepts and real molecular systems. In this experiment,
students explore the keto–enol tautomerization of
2,4-pentanedione. However, unlike in prior versions of this
experiment, students follow a line of inquiry about data collection
and interpretation. Students are provided many structured
opportunities to discuss and collaborate on the analysis of data. A
general outline of the experiment is provided that highlights areas of
student decision-making and inquiry-based learning about the
thermodynamics of this equilibrium system. A description of student
activities and outcomes shows that students are afforded a number of
opportunities to build their own understanding and make decisions
about experimental design.
