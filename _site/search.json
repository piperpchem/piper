    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper is intended to serve as a bridge between introductory textbooks on quantum mechanics, which typically do not cover the Hartree-Fock self-consistent-field method, and more advanced ones which treat this important computational method for fermionic many-body systems in an abstract and formal way. We derive the Hartree-Fock equation for the 1s orbital of a realistic two-electron atom. By employing a two-dimensional basis-set representation, we avoid the use of variational calculus and are able to visualize key aspects of the method. We explain the basic self-consistent-field algorithm and provide a python script to illustrate how the algorithm works in practice. Utilizing perturbation theory, we perform an analysis of the convergence behavior of the self-consistent-field algorithm, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the numerical examples presented. We expect that this work will be useful for teaching computational techniques to physics students."

    "text": "ACS Symposium Series\nThis book reflects the diversity of physical chemistry experiences of the authors themselves. Some chapters provide suggestions to increase engagement by providing new, intriguing contexts such as protein interactions and surface chemistry through which to teach traditional physical chemistry concepts. Other chapters focus on pedagogy, presenting ideas on how to increase the active involvement of students in their own learning or how to help students memorize difficult thermodynamic equations. Still other chapters challenge traditional instructional notions with ideas such as using flipped classrooms and incorporating a graphic novel. In general, we organized the chapters according to these broad categories, although some chapters bridge categories.\nIn short, this book has a little bit of a lot of different things. However, there are twin unifying threads present throughout. First, this book was written by people interested in physical chemistry education who wanted to improve student learning in their classes. Second, this book was written for those who share our passions about teaching and learning physical chemistry.\nAs mentioned above, each of us has our own particular setting in which we teach our students physical chemistry. Thus, you will probably not be able to implement all the ideas from the chapters directly into your own classroom and laboratory because specific details about each author’s situation will not likely match your own. Therefore, this book is not so much a step-by-step instruction manual as it is a resource for ideas, guidance, and inspiration for improving your own physical chemistry curriculum for the purpose of engaging students."

    "text": "While computational chemistry methods are usually a research topic of their own, even in the undergraduate curriculum, many methods are becoming mainstream and can be used to appropriately compute chemical parameters that are not easily measured in the undergraduate laboratory. These calculations can be used to help students explore and understand chemical principles and properties. Visualization and animation of structures and properties are also aids in students’ exploration of chemistry. The ubiquity of personal computing devices capable of running calculations and the user-friendliness of software to fully optimize small and medium molecules using graphical interfaces and drop-down control menus has made it possible to readily use computational chemistry tools in most chemistry courses in the undergraduate curriculum. This book will focus on the use of computational chemistry as a tool in the classroom and laboratory to teach chemical principles."

    "text": "This tool defines relations that all high school and college students would recognize as mathematical equations. They consist of a left hand side (lhs) and a right hand side (rhs) connected by the relation operator “=”. This tool applies operations to both sides of the equation simultaneously, just as students are taught to do when attempting to isolate (solve for) a variable. Thus the statement Equation/b yields a new equation Equation.lhs/b = Equation.rhs/b The intent is to allow using the mathematical tools in SymPy to rearrange equations and perform algebra in a stepwise fashion using as close to standard mathematical notation as possible. In this way more people can successfully perform algebraic rearrangements without stumbling over missed details such as a negative sign."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: Students’ negative perceptions of physical chemistry courses are well-known and are likely impacting their learning and performance in this upper-division course for majors. The syllabus can be the first interaction students have with a course and instructor and can be central to the expectations student set for the learning experience. While syllabi are not necessarily evidence of enacted classroom practice, their focus may be related to the enacted course design and instructional practices. Additionally, developing and modifying the document gives an instructor an opportunity to reflect on those same enacted practices, potentially facilitating a more learning-centered experience for students. In this study, we collected physical chemistry syllabi from across the United States and evaluated the learning-centeredness of this document using the Measuring the Promise syllabus rubric. Physical chemistry syllabi from 2017 to 2019 were largely content-focused. Analysis of the specific components of syllabi revealed potential improvements that may shift the focus of physical chemistry syllabi toward the learning end of the learning-centeredness spectrum. These include communicating learning goals and objectives across a wide range of dimensions, introducing transparency about the alignment of assessments with objectives, and creating supportive classroom climates via the syllabus."

    "text": "Of the three main subdivisions in chemistry, physical chemistry often presents a challenge when delivered to those not majoring in chemistry or its cognate disciplines. This is, at least in part, due to the seemingly unrelatedness of the subject to students’ anticipated career. We describe the redesign of a nested physical chemistry course for health science majors using a context-based learning approach. Each of the major themes of introductory physical chemistry (viz., gas laws, equilibrium, thermodynamics, kinetics, and electrochemistry) is taught and assessed using examples drawn from anesthesia. We summarize the motivations for this change and provide a range of examples demonstrating how basic physical chemistry can be related to anesthesia. The aim of this article is to provide instructors with interesting examples that they can incorporate either fully or in part into their curricula."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nowadays, many chemical investigations can be supported theoretically by routine molecular structure calculations, conformer ensembles, reaction energies, barrier heights, and predicted spectroscopic properties. Such standard computational chemistry applications are most often conducted with density functional theory (DFT) and atom-centered atomic orbital basis sets implemented in many standard quantum chemistry software packages. This work aims to provide general guidance on the various technical and methodological aspects of DFT calculations for molecular systems, and how to achieve an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency through multi-level approaches. The main points discussed are the density functional, the atomic orbital basis sets, and the computational protocol to describe and predict experimental behavior properly. This is done in three main parts: Firstly, in the form of a step-by-step decision tree to guide the overall computational approach depending on the problem; secondly, using a recommendation matrix that addresses the most critical aspects regarding the functional and basis set depending on the computational task at hand (structure optimization, reaction energy calculations, etc.); and thirdly, by applying all steps to some representative examples to illustrate the recommended protocols and effect of methodological choices."

    "text": "The Hofmeister series is a recurring trend that ranks ions’ abilities to influence various aqueous processes in solution. Herein, a set of project-based experiments was developed for students in an upper-level physical chemistry laboratory to investigate the specific ion effects on the thermodynamics of caffeine partitioning between aqueous and cyclohexane phases. Students obtained the standard Gibbs free energy for caffeine partitioning in the presence of eight sodium salts in the aqueous phase at varied temperatures. The standard enthalpy and entropy for caffeine partitioning were obtained by plotting the standard Gibbs free energy vs temperature for each salt. Students then identified the trends in the thermodynamics for caffeine partitioning and explored the correlation between anions’ properties and their influence on caffeine partitioning thermodynamic parameters. This project-based laboratory allowed students to gain a deep understanding of ion properties in solution and learn how the Hofmeister ions affect various aqueous processes. It also helped students internalize some fundamental concepts in thermodynamics such as standard Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy.\nSupporting Information includes students’ raw data, correlation plots for strongly hydrated anions, and notes for instructors."

    "section": "",
    "text": "You are making a meal and the recipe you are using calls for canned chickpea, but you do not have a can of chickpeas. While searching your kitchen, you find a bag of dried chickpeas. Can you use the dried chickpeas instead of the canned chickpeas? Should you go back to the store just to buy a can of chickpeas, or can you soak the chickpeas you already have? Will the meal be ready in time?\nThe first phase (Experiment Part One) is an exploratory phase in which students become accustomed to the system of hydrating chickpeas by conducting some initial investigations. Experiment Part One can be completed in a single three-hour lab session if the students are given the salt solutions already made. If students have to prepare the solutions the instructor might need some additional class time to discuss the final results of the first session.\nThe second phase (Experiment Part Two) focuses on modeling hydration and should begin towards the end of the first session of activity. The data for this long term soaking will be collected during session two. Analysis of the suitability of Peleg’s equation can be done using EXCEL or other spreadsheet programs (plot.ly is available for free).\nA third phase (which is optional, but highly encouraged) involves students selecting some aspect of bean hydration and developing their own investigations on it. For these additional investigations, the class may decide to all focus on the same topic. Alternately, each group of students may decide to pursue unique projects.\nThe basic version of this experiment is expected to take two three-hour lab periods. A more complete version would require three periods."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past half century, computational chemistry has evolved from a niche field to a ubiquitous pillar of modern chemical research. Driven by the increased demand for computational chemistry in research settings, the undergraduate curriculum has evolved alongside to ensure that students are well-equipped for modern research. Toward this end, many excellent computational chemistry exercises have been developed that aim to teach students what kinds of questions computational chemistry can answer and how to properly interpret the results. However, there has been far less attention given to the complexities of determining how reliable computational results are and how constraining computational scaling can be. We present an undergraduate lab exercise that uses ab initio methods to predict the combustion energy of methane. The exercise walks students through the process of benchmarking errors on a small system (methane), estimating the computational cost to perform the same analysis on a larger system (propane), and justifying an affordable yet accurate method for a hypothetical study of the larger system. Furthermore, students are introduced to other cost-saving measures like basis set extrapolation and additive corrections. The entire exercise is intentionally designed to require little technical knowledge of computational chemistry and to be flexibly grafted into a standard undergraduate curriculum. In order to ensure accessibility, the exercise utilizes the free open source software Psi4 (available on any operating system) and provides a detailed installation and use guide for completing this lab. This lab will provide students the understanding of how to properly judge, select, and justify different computational models where cost and accuracy compete, a highly desirable set of skills that generalize to any computational science."

    "text": "An ongoing need exists for the creation of interdisciplinary working groups in the sciences and development of pedagogical approaches to content themes that tie together different scientific disciplines. The work described here addresses this need through the development of a collaborative faculty group and a process of content and pedagogical development around the central interdisciplinary theme of energy conservation and transfer, taught in various lower and upper level courses in physics, biology, and chemistry. Our main goal was to design conceptual, visual models that addressed our energy topic and allowed us to provide related, challenging, active-learning experiences that students could easily recognize and expand upon in subsequent courses as they progressed through our curriculum. We used an assessment-first approach in which we designed models with our student outcomes in mind and then created course approaches around our assessment tools. Early indications suggest that students are challenged by and appreciative of these learning approaches, especially when more advanced models are developed in advanced courses in the Physics of Medicine curriculum."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn the midst of a global pandemic in spring 2020, physical chemistry faculty gathered to share strategies and resources for teaching remotely. During this conversation, instructors created a shared document compiling the challenges they faced in spring 2020 and ways to improve teaching and learning in the physical chemistry classroom and laboratory when institutions reopened in the fall. We present a content analysis of the shared document that provides a snapshot of physical chemists’ thoughts at that moment in June 2020. The themes that emerged from our analysis are assessment, choice of learning objectives, course management, opportunities, resources, student motivation, and wellbeing. We have summarized the numerous strategies, resources, and implementation ideas that were shared by participants, many of which we believe will remain in use when traditional in-person instruction resumes. Finally, the conversation connected physical chemists, strengthening our community. Continued community engagement has occurred through further synchronous conversations, asynchronous conversations on our Slack workspace, and the creation of the repository PChem Inspired Pedagogical Electronic Resource (PIPER)."

    "text": "Over the past 20 years, significant effort has been devoted to advancing the modular approach to teaching chemistry laboratory courses. The development and implementation of two modules are presented here for teaching a second-semester physical chemistry laboratory course using the modular approach: an inquiry-based module concerning proteins and a project-based module concerning organic small molecules. Each module focuses on a molecular system in question and allows participating students to choose and apply various methods to study the system in different ways, according to the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The common thrust of all of the modules is to develop students’ critical thinking skills, provide them a conduit to apply their knowledge to real applications, encourage them to model the approaches and behavior of practicing scientists, and excite them to initiate and pursue research opportunities. Details of implementation of this modular approach in teaching the second-semester physical chemistry laboratory for the past 11 years are provided. The assessment results indicate encouraging evidence that this two-level modular approach has achieved its goals and assisted students in choosing more research-based careers."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Density functional theory (DFT) has rapidly became the method of choice for the calculation of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules in both the teaching and the research environments. Despite a long history of successes in both fields, DFT still retains several limitations due to the fact that it relies on approximations. Advances on the research side have recently contributed to understand and reduce several of these limitations. The most important results have been obtained in the last two decades by using large databases of accurate data. These databases provided a better understanding of the limitations of current approximations and facilitated the development of more accurate ones. The educational literature, on the other side, has unfortunately remained behind. It is still common, in fact, to find computational laboratory courses that use outdated approximations, without providing a clear report of their limitations, and also failing to mention the modern alternatives. This article introduces a laboratory notebook for a computational chemistry course based on recent advances in DFT research. New approximations and neglected techniques are presented and discussed using data from modern research databases. The course is aimed at upper undergraduate and graduate students, but it includes enough research examples to be interesting for occasional practitioners and beginner researchers as well."

    "text": "Many chemical experiments give us a macroscopic view of a chemical system, but we still have to develop an interpretation of what we observe in terms of the interaction between molecules. Static models of molecules typically give us a view of these systems that does not reflect their dynamical nature at the submicroscopic level. We can use molecular dynamics simulations to gain a better sense of the kinds of motions that molecules typically execute and the timescales on which these motions occur. We can also examine properties that are pretty much inaccessible to experiment, such as the relative importance of Coulomb and van der Waals forces in a simulation. We can also use visualization techniques to develop pictorial models of molecular structure and motion. Such visualizations are often helpful in pointing the way toward other simulations and data analysis that can further explain the nature of the chemical system."

With judicious planning, the entire experiment can be run in two 4 hour laboratory periods. Alternatively, this experiment could be offered as an open-ended, multiperiod project."

    "text": "This article describes an undergraduate laboratory exercise that uses optical spectroscopy to determine the magnitude and the uncertainty of the Boltzmann constant kb. The more accurate approach uses photoacoustic spectroscopy to measure the Doppler-broadened line profile of individual spectral lines of N2O to extract kb. Measurements and estimates of the uncertainties in the quantities needed to calculate kb from the line profiles are then used to estimate the uncertainty in kb. This experiment is unusual in that it uses advanced laser-based spectroscopy techniques to emphasize standard practices of uncertainty analysis. The core instrumentation is modular and relatively affordable; it requires a tunable single-mode laser, photoreceiver, optical cell, and vacuum pump. If this instrumentation is not available, an alternate approach can be performed which uses the intensity of each rotational transition of an infrared band to measure kb. Although there is more uncertainty using the alternate approach, low concentrations of CO2, DCl, or N2O give reasonable results for the magnitude of kb. Student assessment results indicate retention and mastery of the concept of combined measurement uncertainty."

    "text": "Long in the making, computational chemistry for the masses is finally here. Our brief review on free and open source software (FOSS) packages points out the existence of software offering a wide range of functionality, all the way from approximate semiempirical calculations with tight-binding density functional theory to sophisticated ab initio wave function methods such as coupled-cluster theory, covering both molecular and solid-state systems. Combined with the remarkable increase in the computing power of personal devices, which now rivals that of the fastest supercomputers in the world in the 1990s, we demonstrate that a decentralized model for teaching computational chemistry is now possible thanks to FOSS packages, enabling students to perform reasonable modeling on their own computing devices in the bring your own device (BYOD) scheme. FOSS software can be made trivially simple to install and keep up to date, eliminating the need for departmental support, and also enables comprehensive teaching strategies, as various algorithms’ actual implementations can be used in teaching. We exemplify what kinds of calculations are feasible with four FOSS electronic structure programs, assuming only extremely modest computational resources, to illustrate how FOSS packages enable decentralized approaches to computational chemistry education within the BYOD scheme. FOSS also has further benefits driving its adoption: the open access to the source code of FOSS packages democratizes the science of computational chemistry, and FOSS packages can be used without limitation also beyond education, in academic and industrial applications, for example."

    "text": "When learning chemistry, students must learn to extract chemical information from mathematical expressions. However, chemistry students’ exposure to mathematics often comes primarily from pure mathematics courses, which can lead to knowledge fragmentation and potentially hinder their ability to use mathematics in chemistry. This study examines how computation can affect students’ blending of cognitive resources and their framing of mathematics in a chemical context. How students analytically and numerically interpret mathematical expressions in chemistry are examined through 14 individual clinical interviews with undergraduate chemistry students. The analysis was done by performing a thematic analysis of the interviews through a theoretical lens provided by the blended processing framework. This analysis reveals that computation and iterative thinking might serve as a catalyst for conceptual understanding and blending of cognitive resources. These findings suggest that we should evaluate how computational approaches could be leveraged to give students a better understanding of both mathematical models and the chemical concepts illustrated through these models."

An analysis of the experimental protocol reveals that the POGIL approach actively engages students in scientific practices. The student learning objectives for this laboratory experiment are to (1) develop an energy level diagram and relate that diagram to rotational–vibrational spectra; (2) identify, describe, and interpret the molecular constants that can be extracted from gas-phase IR spectra; (3) discover the impact of spectral resolution on precision of molecular constants derived from the spectral data; and (4) use data to evaluate and refine quantum mechanical models. The learning cycles, analysis of student engagement with scientific practices, and reflections from instructors are described."

Coding is generally of paramount importance to chemistry students regardless of whether they intend to work with theoretical chemistry. Google Colab notebooks can introduce students to programming concepts and could be a convenient tool to assist in the chemistry teaching process. In this article, we implemented Google Colab notebooks to aid in the teaching of thermodynamics in a physical chemistry class. We presented six notebooks, covering introductory concepts of both coding and thermodynamics as a set of learning objects that can be useful in a virtual learning environment. In addition, in some of the notebooks, we included a step-by-step guide on how to run virtual lab simulations. The Colab notebooks were created for students without previous experience in programming. All of the Colab notebooks contain exercises of the activities and the solutions of the proposed exercises. Furthermore, all of the Colab notebooks can be modified and downloaded from the Github repository. Finally, we used the Python programming language and Colab because they are free and widely used by the academic community.\nSessions in English and Spanish:"

    "text": "A physical chemistry lab for undergraduate students described in this report is about applying kinetic models to analyze the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and obtain the reproduction numbers. The susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model and the SIR-vaccinated (SIRV) model are explained to the students and are used to analyze the COVID-19 spread data from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The basic reproduction number R0 and the real-time reproduction number Rt of COVID-19 are extracted by fitting the data with the models, which explains the spreading kinetics and provides a prediction of the spreading trend in a given state. The procedure outlined here shows the differences between the SIR model and the SIRV model. The SIRV model considers the effect of vaccination which helps explain the later stages of the ongoing pandemic. The predictive power of the models is also shown giving the students some certainty in the predictions they made for the following months.\nThis laboratory procedure can be completed in two weeks (4 three-hour labs). The students are instructed to collect literature research, process data, write reports, and receive additional instruction outside of class time if needed.\nExtending the kinetic model from SIR to SIRV helps the students to understand the later stages of disease prevention and experience kinetic model selection. Comparing the Rt and Re values help the students to distinguish the second-order reaction and the quasi-first order reaction models for the same reaction mechanism, which echoes what they have learned in the class well."

The students designed and built a double-beam photometer using their smartphones and household materials, then prepared a series of dye-solutions with well-known relative concentrations and measured the absorbance–concentration calibration curve. After 24 h of adsorption to kitchen absorbent paper the solutions were visibly decolored. The students were able to determine the equilibrium dye concentrations from absorbance measurements and to calculate the adsorption isotherm. This home-lab experiment allowed them to keep on track with their lessons during the severe lock down in Spain due to COVID-19. They were highly motivated and achieved the learning objectives to a similar degree as in years before with conventional lab equipment."

The first activity, aimed at undergraduate physical chemistry lab courses, involves students writing Python code in a Jupyter Notebook that is used to run LJ simulations and fit a Van der Waals gas model to data produced by the LJ fluid simulations. The second is a jigsaw activity, aimed at advanced undergraduate or graduate students, where students are assigned different sections of the LJ fluid simulation code, and must demonstrate the functionality of their section to the class by both giving an oral presentation and sharing a Jupyter Notebook demonstration of their own design.\nThis lab activity is intended to be used as part of an undergraduate physical chemistry lab course, but really the only prerequisite is that the student knows how to take the derivative of a polynomial. The activity does require students to write some Python code, but the video link above explains things so that the activity be completed by students who have not written code."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: Techniques from the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning (ML) have been applied to a wide range of problems in chemistry. Nonetheless, there are very few examples of pedagogical activities to introduce ML to chemistry students in the chemistry education literature. Here we report a computational activity that introduces undergraduate physical chemistry students to ML in the context of vibrational spectroscopy. In the first part of the activity, students use ML binary classification algorithms to distinguish between carbonyl-containing and non-carbonyl-containing molecules on the basis of their infrared absorption spectra. In the second part of the activity, students test modifications to this basic analysis, including different analysis parameters, different ML algorithms, and different test datasets. In a final extension of the activity, students implement a multiclass classification to predict whether carbonyl-containing molecules contain a ketone, a carboxylic acid, or another carbonyl group. This activity is designed to introduce students both to the basic workflow of a ML classification analysis and to some of the ways in which machine learning analyses can fail. We provide a comprehensive handout for the activity, including theoretical background and a detailed protocol, as well as datasets and code to implement the exercise in Python or Mathematica. This activity is designed as a standalone exercise for physical chemistry lab classes but can also be integrated with courses or modules on vibrational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. On the basis of student surveys, we conclude that this activity was successful in introducing students to applications of ML in chemistry."

Mathematical Methods for Molecular Science is designed to support a one semester course that builds on the introductory calculus sequence and covers critical topics in multivariate calculus, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, linear algebra, and group theory."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper presents MATLAB user interfaces for two multiphase kinetic models: the kinetic double-layer model of aerosol surface chemistry and gas–particle interactions (K2-SURF) and the kinetic multilayer model of aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (KM-SUB). Each interface has simple and user-friendly features that allow undergraduate and graduate students in physical, environmental, and atmospheric chemistry classes to learn about multiphase chemistry modeling without prior computer programming or modeling experience. It is easy to input parameters, and the simulation results are promptly displayed in the interface; thus, these model interfaces are particularly suitable for in-classroom and homework teaching applications. The model input parameters include surface and bulk reaction rate coefficients, surface accommodation coefficient, and gas and bulk diffusivities, while model outputs include gas uptake coefficient and surface and bulk concentrations. Students can use the K2-SURF interface to simulate surface processes and the KM-SUB interface to simulate surface and bulk processes. Example simulations were performed for each interface to present atmospherically relevant applications and to demonstrate its versatility for exploring model sensitivity on various kinetic parameters. The K2-SURF interface was used to show how the rate of ozone uptake by an organic surface and temporal evolution of surface concentrations are affected by the surface accommodation coefficient, desorption lifetime, and surface reaction rate coefficient. Additionally, the KM-SUB interface was applied to demonstrate how bulk diffusivities impact the degradation kinetics of oleic acid particles, so that students can learn how the phase state (liquid vs semisolid vs glassy solid) impacts multiphase chemical kinetics. The developed K2-SURF and KM-SUB interfaces are effective tools for modeling surface and bulk reactions in college-level educational settings, helping students to obtain a deeper understanding of the complex behaviors of heterogeneous and multiphase systems."

The experiment was performed in one 4 h session with students working in groups of 2–3 people.

We have developed an open-access, interactive, electronic notebook that leverages a user-friendly interface to engage a new generation of visual learners with QD. We begin each topic (e.g., adiabaticity, light–matter interactions, and relaxation processes) with essential questions, issues, and background that orient the learner; we then move directly to visual explorations of the phenomena, where the learner can immediately manipulate parameters that control and drive the physics. This notebook requires only a computer that can run Wolfram’s computable document format (CDF) files (both the notebook and CDF player are free) and enables learning in a variety of contexts and grade levels: flipped classrooms, small groups, and high school students through advanced researchers. Without sacrificing rigor, Quantum Dynamics…with the Dynamics! (QDWD) aims to develop physical intuition and is built in the spirit of hands-on experimentation with immediate and visual results. The hierarchical structure of QDWD lends itself to differentiated instruction, where a motivated or advanced student can explore the computer code, mathematical formalism, and underpinning physics."

    "text": "The concepts taught in an undergraduate physical chemistry course are directly related to the molecular processes governing climate change, yet the connections between quantum mechanical molecular properties and global warming are rarely made explicit. To improve student knowledge about climate change, we developed a three-part activity that computationally and experimentally explores blackbody radiation, the greenhouse effect, and the relationship between IR absorption properties and global warming potentials for the anthropogenic greenhouse gases defined in the Paris Agreement. The activities addressed the traditional learning objectives of a quantum-focused physical chemistry course by exploring topics such as the quantized nature of energy in Planck’s Law, the selection rules for rovibrational transitions, and discrepancies between theoretical models and observed experimental results. However, our approach was unique in that each concept was addressed within the context of the atmospheric phenomena related to climate change. A previously published climate science survey instrument was administered pre- and postactivity to assess student learning gains. The average percent of correct responses on this survey increased from 44% to 68% as a result of completing the activities.\nThe activities focused on (1) blackbody radiation and the greenhouse effect, (2) collection and interpretation of the IR spectrum of carbon dioxide, and (3) calculation of the GWPs of several anthropogenic greenhouse gases based on IR vibrational intensities generated from density functional theory (DFT) calculations."

Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the apparent nucleation of crystalline material. In this paper a simple experiment is described that demonstrates that nucleation is triggered by preserving seed crystals clamped between opposing metal surfaces. An explanation for the retention of the crystalline particles is the elevated melting point caused by very high local pressures. A series of thermophysical properties of the sodium acetate solution is also measured, including the available enthalpy upon crystallization of the supercooled substance, and liquid and solid phase specific heat capacities."

The inquiry-based physical chemistry experiments being developed emphasize modeling of chemical phenomena. In each experiment, students work through at least two learning cycles in which they make predictions, collect data, model the data, and discuss its meaning. The design of the student laboratory experiences resembles the apprenticeship model of research because students carry out an experiment with faculty guidance to determine which parameters are best modified in subsequent trials of the same experiment. The POGIL-PCL model is illustrated using the example: “What are the kinetic parameters of a heterogeneous reaction?” Typical student results and responses are discussed."

    "text": "In the 21st Century, research is increasingly data- and computation-driven. Researchers, funders, and the larger community today emphasize the traits of openness and reproducibility. In March 2017, 13 mostly early-career research leaders who are building their careers around these traits came together with ten university leaders (presidents, vice presidents, and vice provosts), representatives from four funding agencies, and eleven organizers and other stakeholders in an NIH- and NSF-funded one-day, invitation-only workshop titled “Imagining Tomorrow’s University.” Workshop attendees were charged with launching a new dialog around open research – the current status, opportunities for advancement, and challenges that limit sharing.\nThe workshop examined how the internet-enabled research world has changed, and how universities need to change to adapt commensurately, aiming to understand how universities can and should make themselves competitive and attract the best students, staff, and faculty in this new world. During the workshop, the participants re-imagined scholarship, education, and institutions for an open, networked era, to uncover new opportunities for universities to create value and serve society. They expressed the results of these deliberations as a set of 22 principles of tomorrow’s university across six areas: credit and attribution, communities, outreach and engagement, education, preservation and reproducibility, and technologies.\nActivities that follow on from workshop results take one of three forms. First, since the workshop, a number of workshop authors have further developed and published their white papers to make their reflections and recommendations more concrete. These authors are also conducting efforts to implement these ideas, and to make changes in the university system. Second, we plan to organise a follow-up workshop that focuses on how these principles could be implemented. Third, we believe that the outcomes of this workshop support and are connected with recent theoretical work on the position and future of open knowledge institutions."

By weighting rotational energy degeneracies with a Boltzmann factor, they simulate the R-branch of the band; the result is a rudimentary estimate of the average temperature of the troposphere above the South Pole. A second activity simulates radiative emission in a saturated part of the spectrum as a Planck Blackbody, which yields the temperature of the atmosphere just above the surface. All computations and graphical displays are done in Jupyter Notebooks."

Critical thinking and active inquiry is promoted by open-ended responses to prompts (Pause for Analysis questions). Specific learning goals are as follows:\n\nLearn about the greenhouse effect.\nLearn how to download and plot a downwelling radiance spectrum from polar regions.\nUnderstand how gases contribute to the greenhouse effect, which are the most important, and how these contributions are unique in Polar Regions.\nExamine infrared spectral features due to rovibrational transitions.\nLearn how to model the populations of rotational states according to degeneracy and temperature.\nLearn how to use that population to infer an effective temperature of atmospheric CO2 in a downwelling emission spectrum from South Pole Station, Antarctica.\nLearn how blackbody radiation is related to downwelling radiation from the atmosphere.\nLearn how to use the Planck function and a downwelling radiance spectrum to estimate the surface temperature."

The activity has successfully been taught in over several class sections or in a longer lab section, for classes of 11 students or less, and is appropriate for up to 30 students. The activity typically takes 3 to 5 hours and includes homework assignments. No previous computational or coding experience is required. The instructor will give an introductory lecture on the quantum-mechanical concepts, assign pre-module homework, guide the students in working through the module, and facilitate group discussions.

    "section": "",
    "text": "An experiment for the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory is described in which the Raman spectrum of liquid para-difluorobenzene is recorded and assigned. A density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the 30 normal modes of the molecule is undertaken using computational chemistry software. Students use group theory to determine which of the modes are Raman active. Guided by these results, they are able to identify 13 of the 15 symmetry-allowed fundamental bands in their Raman spectrum. The remaining 17 observed bands are assigned as either overtone or combination bands, by estimating the wavenumbers of symmetry-allowed transitions from the scaled results of their DFT calculation. The experiment demonstrates the powerful way in which group theory and computational chemistry can be used to assign a dense Raman spectrum of an organic compound.\nThe acquisition and measurement of the Raman lines of pDFB takes about 45 min, whereas the data analysis requires 3–4 h, depending on how fast a team works. Students begin their vibrational analysis by identifying the symmetries of the vibrational normal modes. They then complete a density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the Raman spectrum using the hybrid functional B3LYP with a 6-311G* basis set. With Spartan 20 software on a laptop computer, this calculation typically takes less than 10 min."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) represents an important class of reactions taught in the undergraduate organic chemistry curriculum. The EAS reaction of benzene and its substituted derivatives is generally described as proceeding through a carbocation (arenium cation) intermediate, and the regiochemistry of the product is heavily influenced by the nature of the substituents. Molecular properties such as frontier molecular orbitals, Hirshfeld charges, and 13C and 1H NMR shifts can predict the directing nature of the substituents. In this upper level laboratory experiment, students calculate these molecular properties to predict the regiochemistry of various aromatic systems. Mono- and disubstituted benzene systems are used to introduce the computational workflow, as these systems are typically covered in an introductory organic chemistry course and their properties yield unambiguous predictions. Then students apply this methodology to unfamiliar systems by predicting the regiochemistry of heteroaromatic molecules including poly substituted and fused-ring systems. The molecular properties for some of these systems yield multiple reasonable predictions, so students must weigh the data to argue where substitution will occur, incorporating additional concepts such as steric effects. By the end of this experiment, students should understand the ways in which several molecular properties aid in predicting regiochemistry for EAS reactions and gain a greater appreciation for the possibilities of using computational chemistry to study reactivity."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A spreadsheet-based exercise for students is described in which they are challenged to explain and reproduce the disparate temperature dependencies of the heat capacities of gaseous F\\(_2\\) and N\\(_2\\). For F\\(_2\\), C\\(_{p,m}\\) increases from 300 K, reaches a maximum at 2200 K, and then decreases to 74% of the maximum value at 6000 K, while C\\(_{p,m}\\) for N\\(_2\\) rises monotonically in this temperature range. Students compare this behavior with the prediction of the equipartition principle and then test four models with increasing sophistication, from closed-form expressions of the harmonic/anharmonic oscillator–rigid/nonrigid rotor to calculations using discrete sums over rovibrational states, all using molecular spectroscopic constants. Fundamental principles of statistical thermodynamics are used to calculate the partition functions, which yield the internal energy, heat capacity, and third-law entropy of the molecules. They encounter the need to include the role of quasibound rotational states that arise from the rotational barrier to molecular dissociation and to employ methods for truncating the sums used in the partition functions. In this exercise, students confront the fact that, for N\\(_2\\), C\\(_{p,m}\\) continues to rise, reaching a maximum at 16,000 K that is 1.8 times the equipartition value. The inclusion of electronically excited states in the partition function is discussed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The reemergence of virtual reality (VR) in the last few years has led to affordable commodity hardware that can offer new ways to teach, communicate and engage with difficult concepts, especially those which involve complicated 3D motion and spatial manipulation. In a higher education context, these immersive technologies make it possible to teach complex molecular topics in a way that may aid or even supersede traditional approaches such as molecular models, textbook images, and traditional screen-based computational environments. In this work we describe a study involving 24 third-year UK undergraduate chemistry students who undertook a traditional computational chemistry class complemented with an additional component utilising real-time interactive molecular dynamics simulations in VR (iMD-VR). Exploiting the flexibility of an open-source iMD-VR framework which we recently described,(1) and building on recent work where we demonstrated the ability to use this framework to run ‘on-the-fly’ density functional theory in VR at interactive speeds,2 we designed three tasks for students to complete in iMD-VR: (1) interactive rearrangement of the chorismate molecule to prephenate using forces obtained from ‘on-the-fly’ density functional theory calculations; (2) unbinding of chorismate from the active site chorismate mutase enzyme using molecular-mechanics forces calculated in real-time; and (3) docking of chorismate with chorismate mutase using real-time molecular mechanics forces. A survey indicated that most students found the iMD-VR component more engaging than the traditional approach, and also that it improved their perceived educational outcomes and their interest in continuing on in the field of computational sciences."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic illuminated challenges with assessment, especially in online environments that threaten academic integrity. In the wake of the pandemic, faculty in higher education were seeking alternative assessments that meet the assessment goal(s) of their classroom. Even though the COVID-based disruptions are diminishing, higher education continues to experience ongoing upheaval related to new technology, such as ChatGPT, requiring ongoing reevaluation of our assessment practices. Upon reflecting on our assessment goals, we explored oral exams as a potentially valuable tool in the assessment toolbox in Physical Chemistry I and II courses at two institutions. In analyzing the course evaluation data at both institutions, we found consistent themes in student-perceived challenges, student-perceived value, and instructor-perceived value. Students had an overwhelmingly positive response to the oral exam experience and recommended their continued use in spite of their perceived challenges. Students found the oral exams challenging due to the stress and anxiety of verbal presentation and the depth of understanding required to answer questions verbally. In response to these challenges, students adjusted their study habits to incorporate studying in groups, verbally speaking out loud, utilizing spaced practice methods, and focusing on understanding concepts and equations instead of relying on memorization of material. Considering the challenges and required adjustment in study habits, students still overwhelmingly recommend using oral exams because they recognize the value of communication and teamwork in their future careers. In addition to student value, the instructors found value in oral assessments, despite the challenges with time commitments, validity, reliability, and fairness. We believe oral assessments in undergraduate chemistry curricula warrant further investigation as a useful tool in the assessment toolbox."

The activities have been tested both in settings that teach quantum first and also those that teach thermodynamics first, and we have found they serve students well in both contexts. Although it is assumed students are familiar with quantized energy levels, the activities do not require prior knowledge of Quantum Mechanics beyond a one-year general chemistry course.\nThe title of each activity includes both a label classifying the content and a number signaling the order. Activities labeled Fundamental, represent the core set of Thermodynamic topics suitable for an undergraduate physical chemistry course. They should be used in the order presented and generally without omission since each subsequent activity was written presuming either implicitly or explicitly the prior content as pre-requisite. Activities labeled StatMech and Kinetics cover content traditionally associated with these subject areas. In general, these activities could be introduced at anytime throughout the course depending on the instructor preference.\nActivities labeled “Extension” are intended to guide students more deeply into a particular topic and are numbered according to the prerequisite activity. Any extension activity can be used or omitted depending on the learning objectives identified for students. We presume that instructors will vary in terms of the details they wish to include on any topic depending on the context of the course they teach and their own interests. We have attempted to provide the necessary flexibility in these materials to allow instructors to present a particular category or extend fundamental concepts as they see fit in the course.\nLists of the content and process objectives describe what each student should achieve after completing the activity. Instructors may want to share this information with students or create assessment and evaluation materials that reinforce these stated objectives.The Instructor’s Guide also indicates the appropriate Extension activities for each Fundamentalactivity. Implementation Notes provide additional ideas or cautions regarding the use of theactivities in the classroom"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ultrafast laser spectroscopy is a valuable and increasingly accessible technique for studies of rapid chemical reactions. Critical to ultrafast spectroscopy is the concept of mode-locking, a technique that enables a fixed phase relationship between laser modes, resulting in laser pulses with very short duration (in the fs or ps range). Despite an increasing importance of ultrafast lasers in chemistry, the introduction of key concepts behind their operation into the undergraduate and graduate chemistry coursework has been limited. To help the incorporation of these topics into chemistry courses, we report here a hands-on activity that helps students develop an intuitive understanding of the factors that impact electromagnetic wave evolution in optical cavities and the process of mode-locking. We first provide the theoretical background by introducing cavity modes and contrasting them with well-known propagating electromagnetic waves. We then explore what happens when modes are added and how the relative phase between the modes affect their behavior. In the second section of the manuscript, three teaching modules are provided, along with associated Matlab codes and animated images, that can be used in the classroom to introduce concepts of cavity modes and mode-locking. These teaching modules start by contrasting propagating electromagnetic waves with cavity modes, then illustrate what happens when multiple modes are present in the cavity and how the relative phase between the modes affects the overall electromagnetic fields in the cavity."

    "text": "A fast track into online teaching in response to the COVID-19 crisis resulted in the author learning to use online platforms and tools to teach thermodynamics and quantum mechanics courses. These resources were used effectively to teach highly mathematical and challenging concepts, as presented in this communication. Student assessment using traditional (exams) and novel (projects) approaches are highlighted, especially the use of projects that examined students’ ability to apply their knowledge to solve real world problems. A survey of students’ responses to online learning revealed that they felt supported during the COVID-19 crisis and the teaching tools described in this work were successful in helping them learn. These students who completed parts of the two courses in face-to-face classes in previous quarters overwhelmingly preferred in-person instruction. The pedagogical approaches described in the communication were shared informally with fellow science faculty at the college. They may be successful in teaching other chemistry courses and STEM fields. The author feels better prepared for teaching online in the future as a result of this teaching experience."

    "text": "A Community of Practice for Improving Inorganic Chemical Education\nWe seek to enhance the inorganic chemistry classroom and laboratory experience for students and faculty members through the development and growth of IONiC (Interactive Online Network of Inorganic Chemists), a vibrant virtual ‘community of practice.’ The community’s foundation will be a cyber-interface that facilitates collaborative development of learning materials and their dissemination to the wider inorganic community. This website, VIPEr (Virtual Inorganic Pedagogical Electronic Resource), will serve both as a repository and as a user-friendly platform for social networking tools that facilitate virtual collaboration and community building. Using VIPEr, we will develop and disseminate best practices for teaching inorganic chemistry.\nWe hope that this project will (1) contribute to the knowledge base of inorganic chemistry teaching by developing, testing, and disseminating new inorganic learning materials; (2) contribute to the understanding of best practices for “virtual communities of practice” by assessing the impact of IONiC on the leadership group and other users; and (3) develop knowledge about the use of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools for faculty and students."

Theoretical introductions for properties such as internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy are provided and students then manipulate variables to answer guided inquiry questions. Specific learning objectives are provided with each activity, and “Pause for analysis” questions encourage careful examination and reflection of the results. A 3-notebook series has students apply learned principles to understand the thermodynamics of Arctic ice melt and sea level rise."
