Specifications (specs) grading systems use a “checklist” approach to assessing students that asks them to demonstrate a high level of proficiency in course content, often coupled with multiple attempts at revision. Students also must demonstrate mastery in some specs to earn high letter grades. There have been several reports in lower division college chemistry courses that use specs grading systems (e.g., general and organic chemistries), but there remains a dearth of accounts of specs grading systems in upper division courses. In this manuscript, we report on the use of specs grading systems at a primarily undergraduate women’s college in four upper division chemistry courses: biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. The conceptual framework for designing specs tailored to upper division chemistry courses and their use to assess student understanding of course content are shared along with student outcomes and feedback. The upper division students generally had a positive view of the specs grading system with students viewing themselves as working hard on assessments that were tough but fair. Finally, instructor comments are presented in an effort to highlight the perceived benefits and challenges of specs grading to future adopters.
