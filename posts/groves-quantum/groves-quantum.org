Course Objectives:
 - Develop an understanding of the nature of quantum systems and apply these principles to solve the Schrödinger Equation and determine physical observables.
 - Understand what it means for a system to be quantized and use the quantized nature of energy to predict spectroscopic phenomena in electronic, vibrational, NMR, and rotational spectroscopies
 - Use the solutions to the Schrödinger Equation to describe how chemical bonds are formed between atoms.
