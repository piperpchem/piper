This work reports a study of thermal effects in nitrogen vacancies in diamond using the optically detected continuous wave magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) method. Changes in the ODMR signal induced by heating the diamond sample with both laser light at various powers and by a simple heater were investigated and analyzed. The influence of heating on the ODMR signal was measured for two types of synthetic diamond powder─a low cost microcrystalline powder (particle diameters ca. 80 μm) and a high purity nanodiamond powder (particle diameters ca. 140 nm). The experimental setup can be viewed as a pedagogical quantum thermometer. A number of cost-effective components were used, e.g., a self-constructed confocal microscope, and the Raspberry Pi 4B microcomputer in an experiment control and data acquisition system, as well as an inexpensive microwave modulator, analog to digital converter, and a heating plate.
