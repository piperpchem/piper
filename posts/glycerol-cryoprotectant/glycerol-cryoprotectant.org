This study describes a laboratory experiment performed with undergraduate physical chemistry students utilizing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine a eutectic phase diagram, measure solution glass transition temperatures (Tg), and predict the glass transition temperature (T_{g}) of water. The DSC techniques employed determine accurate equilibrium freezing temperatures (Tf) of glycerol–water mixtures with glycerol mole fractions (x_{g}) between 0 and 0.201. When x_{g} ≥ 0.300, the slow rate of crystallization of glycerol inhibits crystallization, and solutions exhibit a T_{g} rather than a T_{f}. The T_{f}'s serve to discuss solid–liquid equilibria and estimate eutectic phase diagrams with varying levels of accuracy. The T_{g}'s serve to estimate the T_{g} of water (135.3 ± 1.2 K). Together, these behaviors allow for discussion of glycerol's effectiveness as a cryoprotectant.
