While computational chemistry methods are usually a research topic of their own, even in the undergraduate curriculum, many methods are becoming mainstream and can be used to appropriately compute chemical parameters that are not easily measured in the undergraduate laboratory. These calculations can be used to help students explore and understand chemical principles and properties. Visualization and animation of structures and properties are also aids in studentsâ€™ exploration of chemistry. The ubiquity of personal computing devices capable of running calculations and the user-friendliness of software to fully optimize small and medium molecules using graphical interfaces and drop-down control menus has made it possible to readily use computational chemistry tools in most chemistry courses in the undergraduate curriculum. This book will focus on the use of computational chemistry as a tool in the classroom and laboratory to teach chemical principles.
