Timing: This experiment takes two or three lab periods, each at least three hours long.


## Learning objectives {#learning-objectives}


### Content Objectives {#content-objectives}

Students will be able to:

-   identify the components of a monomer and excimer energy diagram; relate energy
    diagram lines, minima and spacing to experimental spectra and thermodynamic
    quantities
-   use spectroscopic methods to quantitatively determine thermodynamic parameters
    and predict changes in spectra based on mathematical relationships
-   become familiar with the operation of a fluorometer and temperature control
    apparatus.


### Process Objectives {#process-objectives}

Students will be able to:

-   explain the relationship between emission and excitation energies in fluorimetry.
-   choose experimental parameters that allow determination of thermodynamic parameters from spectroscopic data.
-   explain the relationship between spectral peaks, a pyrene monomer, and the formation of an excimer.
-   apply mathematical models to data; use graphical methods to determine values for ΔS0 and ΔH0 by identifying the dependent and independent variables in a linear relation and relate these variables to measurable quantities in the lab.
-   locating the desired properties from a linearized, graphed relationship using the slope and intercept.
