For\nF$_2$, C$_{p,m}$ increases from 300 K, reaches a maximum at 2200 K,\nand then decreases to 74% of the maximum value at 6000 K, while C$_{p,m}$\nfor N$_2$ rises monotonically in this temperature range. Students compare\nthis behavior with the prediction of the equipartition principle and\nthen test four models with increasing sophistication, from closed-form\nexpressions of the harmonic/anharmonic oscillator–rigid/nonrigid rotor\nto calculations using discrete sums over rovibrational states, all\nusing molecular spectroscopic constants. Fundamental principles of\nstatistical thermodynamics are used to calculate the partition\nfunctions, which yield the internal energy, heat capacity, and\nthird-law entropy of the molecules. They encounter the need to include\nthe role of quasibound rotational states that arise from the\nrotational barrier to molecular dissociation and to employ methods for\ntruncating the sums used in the partition functions. In this exercise,\nstudents confront the fact that, for N$_2$, C$_{p,m}$ continues to rise,\nreaching a maximum at 16,000 K that is 1.8 times the equipartition\nvalue. The inclusion of electronically excited states in the partition\nfunction is discussed.\n\n\n\nArthur M. Halpern and Robert J.
