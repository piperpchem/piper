# About

LABSIP (Lowering Access Barriers to Success in Physical Chemistry) is
a collaborative project led by eleven physical chemistry instructors
and funded initially by Research Corporation for Science
Advancement. Our short-term goal is community engagement around new
directions in Physical Chemistry instruction, with a longer-term goal
of providing guidelines and resources towards a more inclusive,
dynamic, and current physical chemistry curriculum.

# LABSIP-created resources

- Discord server (community discussion space)
- Youtube channel
- Allourideas polls on PChem content items: provided anecdotal evidence of some
  clear community preferences on the importance (or not) of specific
  topics in PChem courses.
