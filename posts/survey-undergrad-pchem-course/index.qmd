A nationwide survey of the undergraduate physical chemistry course was
conducted to investigate the depth and breadth of content that is
covered, how content is delivered, how student understanding is
assessed, and the experiences and beliefs of instructors. The survey
was administered to instructors of physical chemistry (N = 331) at
American Chemical Society certified colleges and universities in the
United States. The majority of instructors (N = 187) provided contact
information, allowing responses to be associated with their
institution. The goal of this preliminary study is to provide an
awareness of the current state of physical chemistry courses across
the United States. Several relationships regarding the course
curriculum were investigated such as depth versus breadth of course
content, and goal for understanding versus types of assessment
questions. Also, several relationships regarding instructor beliefs
and experiences were investigated such as degree of teacher
preparation experience versus course delivery, and instructor beliefs
about the challenging nature of physical chemistry education versus
proposed strategies to overcome those challenges. Information gained
from this study may inform the development of new teaching practices,
curriculum, assessments, and resources for physical chemistry
education, as well as encourage instructors of physical chemistry and
researches of chemical education to work together to improve student
understanding of physical chemistry.
