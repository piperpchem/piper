The POGIL-PCL project implements the principles of process-oriented, guided-inquiry learning (POGIL) in order to improve student learning in the physical chemistry laboratory (PCL) course. The inquiry-based physical chemistry experiments being developed emphasize modeling of chemical phenomena. In each experiment, students work through at least two learning cycles in which they make predictions, collect data, model the data, and discuss its meaning. The design of the student laboratory experiences resembles the apprenticeship model of research because students carry out an experiment with faculty guidance to determine which parameters are best modified in subsequent trials of the same experiment. The POGIL-PCL model is illustrated using the example: "What are the kinetic parameters of a heterogeneous reaction?" Typical student results and responses are discussed.
