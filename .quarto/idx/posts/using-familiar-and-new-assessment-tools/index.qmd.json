Student assessment using traditional (exams) and novel (projects) approaches are highlighted, especially the use of projects that examined students’ ability to apply their knowledge to solve real world problems. A survey of students’ responses to online learning revealed that they felt supported during the COVID-19 crisis and the teaching tools described in this work were successful in helping them learn. These students who completed parts of the two courses in face-to-face classes in previous quarters overwhelmingly preferred in-person instruction. The pedagogical approaches described in the communication were shared informally with fellow science faculty at the college.
