## The framework for a POGIL-PCL Experiment {#the-framework-for-a-pogil-pcl-experiment}

We want the student goal in the Physical Chemistry lab to be learning how physical chemistry is done. Unfortunately, most students experience a laboratory where their goal is to replicate previously determined physical constants.

We have developed this cycle to describe the process of student activity in a POGIL-PCL experiment.

Basic Principles of a POGIL-PCL Experiment include the following:


### Pre-experiment: students work in teams to {#pre-experiment-students-work-in-teams-to}

-   explore background information
-   consider experimental design
-   predict an outcome


### Experimental Protocols that {#experimental-protocols-that}

-   provide broad instructions: e.g., exact masses or volumes omitted
-   are repeated, often with minor variations: e.g., change the temperature, pH, concentration, or species
-   may require use of shared data: e.g., use different form of magnesium


### Thinking about the data: students work in teams to {#thinking-about-the-data-students-work-in-teams-to}

-   pool data to discern trends
-   examine and apply models
-   repeat procedure based on discussion
-   develop concepts outlined in experiment objectives
