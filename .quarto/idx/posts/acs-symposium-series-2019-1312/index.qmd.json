These calculations can be used to help students explore and understand chemical principles and properties. Visualization and animation of structures and properties are also aids in students’ exploration of chemistry. The ubiquity of personal computing devices capable of running calculations and the user-friendliness of software to fully optimize small and medium molecules using graphical interfaces and drop-down control menus has made it possible to readily use computational chemistry tools in most chemistry courses in the undergraduate curriculum.
