Surely an important application of kinetic models is to understand the fate of the beer head on a pint. An effective model can be developed for a fermentation process (a zymurgistâ€™s concern) but foam dynamics are important to water treatment plants, chemical production facilities, and agriculture. Indeed, the production and use of surfactants to control foam dynamics is a multi-billion dollar industry.

In this activity, students determine rate laws that model the foam dynamics of
different beer types.



## Learning Objectives {#learning-objectives}

In this activity students will

-   determine the order of a reaction using graphical analysis and curve-fitting
-   distinguish processes using kinetic models
-   use the numpy curve_fit() function for linear and non-linear curve fitting
-   import data from a csv file
-   generate plots using matplotlib
