Over the past half century, computational chemistry has evolved from a
niche field to a ubiquitous pillar of modern chemical research. Driven
by the increased demand for computational chemistry in research
settings, the undergraduate curriculum has evolved alongside to ensure
that students are well-equipped for modern research. Toward this end,
many excellent computational chemistry exercises have been developed
that aim to teach students what kinds of questions computational
chemistry can answer and how to properly interpret the
results. However, there has been far less attention given to the
complexities of determining how reliable computational results are and
how constraining computational scaling can be. We present an
undergraduate lab exercise that uses ab initio methods to predict the
combustion energy of methane. The exercise walks students through the
process of benchmarking errors on a small system (methane), estimating
the computational cost to perform the same analysis on a larger system
(propane), and justifying an affordable yet accurate method for a
hypothetical study of the larger system. Furthermore, students are
introduced to other cost-saving measures like basis set extrapolation
and additive corrections. The entire exercise is intentionally
designed to require little technical knowledge of computational
chemistry and to be flexibly grafted into a standard undergraduate
curriculum. In order to ensure accessibility, the exercise utilizes
the free open source software Psi4 (available on any operating system)
and provides a detailed installation and use guide for completing this
lab. This lab will provide students the understanding of how to
properly judge, select, and justify different computational models
where cost and accuracy compete, a highly desirable set of skills that
generalize to any computational science.
