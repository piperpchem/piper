Abstract: Techniques from the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine
learning (ML) have been applied to a wide range of problems in
chemistry. Nonetheless, there are very few examples of pedagogical
activities to introduce ML to chemistry students in the chemistry
education literature. Here we report a computational activity that
introduces undergraduate physical chemistry students to ML in the
context of vibrational spectroscopy. In the first part of the
activity, students use ML binary classification algorithms to
distinguish between carbonyl-containing and non-carbonyl-containing
molecules on the basis of their infrared absorption spectra. In the
second part of the activity, students test modifications to this basic
analysis, including different analysis parameters, different ML
algorithms, and different test datasets. In a final extension of the
activity, students implement a multiclass classification to predict
whether carbonyl-containing molecules contain a ketone, a carboxylic
acid, or another carbonyl group. This activity is designed to
introduce students both to the basic workflow of a ML classification
analysis and to some of the ways in which machine learning analyses
can fail. We provide a comprehensive handout for the activity,
including theoretical background and a detailed protocol, as well as
datasets and code to implement the exercise in Python or
Mathematica. This activity is designed as a standalone exercise for
physical chemistry lab classes but can also be integrated with courses
or modules on vibrational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. On
the basis of student surveys, we conclude that this activity was
successful in introducing students to applications of ML in chemistry.
