Many chemical experiments give us a macroscopic view of a chemical system, but
we still have to develop an interpretation of what we observe in terms of the
interaction between molecules. Static models of molecules typically give us a
view of these systems that does not reflect their dynamical nature at the
submicroscopic level. We can use molecular dynamics simulations to gain a better
sense of the kinds of motions that molecules typically execute and the
timescales on which these motions occur. We can also examine properties that are
pretty much inaccessible to experiment, such as the relative importance of
Coulomb and van der Waals forces in a simulation. We can also use visualization
techniques to develop pictorial models of molecular structure and motion. Such
visualizations are often helpful in pointing the way toward other simulations
and data analysis that can further explain the nature of the chemical system.

## Learning Objectives {#learning-objectives}


### Content objectives {#content-objectives}

Students will

-   Describe the relationship between molecular shape, van der Waals energy, and
    enthalpy of vaporization;
-   Differentiate between intermolecular and intramolecular energies (nonbonded
    and bonded interactions);
-   Predict macroscopic properties such as the enthalpies and temperatures of
    phase transitions using molecular dynamics simulations.


### Process objectives {#process-objectives}

Students will

-   Describe the importance of locating equilibrium in a molecular dynamics
    simulation;
-   Perform an energy decomposition and analyze the contributions of different
    forms of energy to the total energy of a system.


## Timing {#timing}

The complete experiment typically takes two lab periods, each at least three
hours long. Instructors can choose to do only Part One, which can be done in one
lab period with perhaps some extra out-of-class work. Another option is to have
students do calculations for Part Two outside of lab and then discuss the
results in a class or partial lab session. (Note that students often want to
perform additional calculations for Part Two once they see their initial
results.)

An instructor's handbook is available upon request.

A supplemental document provides instructions for using [ChemCompute](https://chemcompute.org/) to perform the molecular dynamics calcuations.
