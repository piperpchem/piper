* MERCURY Consortium July 2025

https://www.mercuryconsortium.org/conference-2025/

July 21-25, 2025

#+html: <img src="images/events-mercury.png" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 10px;"/>
The 2025 MERCURY Conference will be hosted by the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh with support from the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute.   The Molecular Sciences Software Institute will host a workshop for students on July 21-22, and the MERCURY Conference will start the evening of July 23 and conclude at lunch on July 25. The conference is an excellent forum for undergraduates to present their work and to learn from experts in the field, allowing them to put their own research into perspective. It is equally valuable as a networking event for faculty working with undergraduates. Undergraduates from all types of institutions are invited to come present their work.

* LABSIP Seminar
#+html: <img src="images/events-labsip.jpg" width="25%" align="right" style="padding-left: 10px;"/>

AUGUST 4, 2025 3-4 pm EST.  Contact pchemlabsip@gmail.com to join the zoom meeting.

Craig Teague will speak about his work in physical chemistry pedagogy and the structure of the undergrad physical chemistry curriculum.

Craig is the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and a Professor of Chemistry at Cornell College. He is co-editor of "Engaging Students in Physical Chemistry" (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/book/10.1021/bk-2018-1279), an ACS Symposium Series eBook, and is at work on a follow-up volume. Craig has co-authored several articles related to chemical pedagogy: “Partition Functions and Statistical Thermodynamics: Spreadsheet Activities to Promote Connections in Physical Chemistry” (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bk-2018-1279.ch004), “Focusing on Student Learning: Efforts at Multiple Levels” (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bk-2020-1343.ch005) and “The Hydrogen Atom Spectrum: Experimental Analysis Using Iterative Model Building” (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00348). Craig mentioned that he will talk a bit about the hydrogen atom spectrum article to illustrate how he thinks about physical chemistry labs through the POGIL-PCL lens so if you get a chance you might want to look over that article.

* Biennial Conference on Chemical Education 2026
 July 26-30, 2026, University of Wisconsin, Madison

 The 29th BCCE will be held on the lakeside campus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the Summer of 2026. The conference, like all of its predecessors, provides the chemistry education community with opportunities to interact and engage. The conference will be a mixture of symposia, workshops, poster sessions, exhibits, and spaces for both formal and informal conversations.

 All chemistry educators are invited to contribute to the conference by submitting a program proposal (opens August 1, 2025), or abstracts for presentations. You do not have to present in order to attend the BCCE. Also, you do not have to be a member of the American Chemical Society or the ACS Division of Chemical Education to attend or present at the BCCE.

This meeting intends to act as a prompt to draw on the latest research and scholarly activity to help us address the future paths where our discipline is headed. The conference will focus specifically on pertinent themes relating to the above, with invited talks and participant posters aligning to one or more of the following:

- Methodological approaches to exploring student understanding and reasoning
- Reforming teaching approaches for a new era of chemistry education
- Refocusing on the role of laboratory teaching
- Individualized learning experiences and the role of artificial intelligence in supporting student learning
- Digital affordances in learning and teaching chemistry
- Epistemology in chemistry
- Global perspectives in chemistry education: sustainability, accessibility, and interdisciplinarity
