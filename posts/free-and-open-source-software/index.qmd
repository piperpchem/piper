Long in the making, computational chemistry for the masses is finally
here. Our brief review on free and open source software (FOSS)
packages points out the existence of software offering a wide range of
functionality, all the way from approximate semiempirical calculations
with tight-binding density functional theory to sophisticated ab
initio wave function methods such as coupled-cluster theory, covering
both molecular and solid-state systems. Combined with the remarkable
increase in the computing power of personal devices, which now rivals
that of the fastest supercomputers in the world in the 1990s, we
demonstrate that a decentralized model for teaching computational
chemistry is now possible thanks to FOSS packages, enabling students
to perform reasonable modeling on their own computing devices in the
bring your own device (BYOD) scheme. FOSS software can be made
trivially simple to install and keep up to date, eliminating the need
for departmental support, and also enables comprehensive teaching
strategies, as various algorithms' actual implementations can be used
in teaching. We exemplify what kinds of calculations are feasible with
four FOSS electronic structure programs, assuming only extremely
modest computational resources, to illustrate how FOSS packages enable
decentralized approaches to computational chemistry education within
the BYOD scheme. FOSS also has further benefits driving its adoption:
the open access to the source code of FOSS packages democratizes the
science of computational chemistry, and FOSS packages can be used
without limitation also beyond education, in academic and industrial
applications, for example.

The repository contains the practical examples of combining the Bring
Your Own Device approach with Free and Open Source Software to run
quantum chemical calculations (BYOD-FOSS). The examples can be found
inside the folders xtb, NWChem, Psi4, and QE.
