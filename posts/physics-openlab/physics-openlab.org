This project’s objective is to share technologies, materials, documentation and experiences realized by a group of science enthusiasts “makers”. Physics open lab is a “laboratory open house” where scientific experiments, especially physics experiments, are described, in order to give you, first-hand, the sense of the key concepts of modern physics, like the radioactivity, the quantization, the wave-particle duality, the cosmic rays and even the strange phenomenon of entanglement.
