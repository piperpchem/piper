This Jupyter notebook has been used in a classroom setting to

-   introduce the functional form of the Morse potential;
-   show the shape of Morse potential;
-   illustrate connections between Morse parameters and molecular parameters
    (equilibrium bond length, bond strength)
-   demonstrate how to use python for computations and visualization.

Instructors may distribute the notebook (with or without code cells), enabling students to see how changes in molecular constants affect the potential.
