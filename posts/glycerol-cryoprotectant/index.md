This study describes a laboratory experiment performed with undergraduate physical chemistry students utilizing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine a eutectic phase diagram, measure solution glass transition temperatures (Tg), and predict the glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of water. The DSC techniques employed determine accurate equilibrium freezing temperatures (Tf) of glycerol–water mixtures with glycerol mole fractions (x<sub>g</sub>) between 0 and 0.201. When x<sub>g</sub> ≥ 0.300, the slow rate of crystallization of glycerol inhibits crystallization, and solutions exhibit a T<sub>g</sub> rather than a T<sub>f</sub>. The T<sub>f</sub>&rsquo;s serve to discuss solid–liquid equilibria and estimate eutectic phase diagrams with varying levels of accuracy. The T<sub>g</sub>&rsquo;s serve to estimate the T<sub>g</sub> of water (135.3 ± 1.2 K). Together, these behaviors allow for discussion of glycerol&rsquo;s effectiveness as a cryoprotectant.
