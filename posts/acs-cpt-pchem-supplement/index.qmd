The ACS Committee on Professional Training (CPT) establishes
guidelines for the approval of bachelor degree programs in
chemistry. The requirements for program approval and student
certification are described in the newly approved 2023 ACS Guidelines
and Evaluation Procedures for Bachelorâ€™s Degree Programs (PDF).



The Committee on Professional Training publishes supplements to the
ACS Guidelines that provide advice to institutions that wish to
develop specific aspects of their chemistry program.
