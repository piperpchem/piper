    "section": "",
    "text": "Previous research extensively explored factors that are associated with instructors’ adoption of evidence-based instructional practices. However, an overlooked yet important aspect is exploring instructors’ motivation for implementing pedagogical innovations that are seemingly popular yet lack evidence of effectiveness. One such innovation that is gaining attention in postsecondary chemistry education is specifications grading, which aims to emphasize the learning process while mitigating some of the drawbacks of traditional grading. This study aims to provide insights into chemistry instructors’ decision to adopt specifications grading. In particular, we interviewed 29 chemistry instructors from 24 academic institutions in the United States who currently use this alternative grading scheme. The goal of these semi-structured interviews was to characterize these instructors’ perceptions of the advantages of specifications grading, their potential dissatisfaction with traditional grading, and potential challenges associated with implementing specifications grading in their courses. Our results indicate that instructors adopted specifications grading as a means to address their dissatisfaction with traditional grading. The commonly cited relative advantages of specifications grading include a perception that specifications grading increases student learning gains and provides greater flexibility for students. These findings provide insight into the dissemination strategy of innovation, highlighting a need for direct alignment between perceived advantages of pedagogical innovations to instructors’ dissatisfaction and instructors’ expressed real-world needs and aspirations for their classroom.\n\nReference\nWang, Ying and Machost, Haleigh and Yik, Brandon J. and Stains, Marilyne, Chem.

    "text": "Symmetry, a common occurrence in nature, holds significant importance in the realm of chemistry education. However, students often struggle to visualize the symmetry elements of three-dimensional molecules and identify point groups using traditional textbooks. In order to address this challenge, we integrated SYVA into VMD for accurate determination of molecular point groups. Additionally, we have organized molecular point group materials to serve as an educational resource. The resource currently includes hundreds of unique molecules, with continuous expansion, to effectively demonstrate various symmetry elements within molecules and aid in determining point groups. Expanding on this resource, we have designed an educational activity focused on molecular symmetry. According to student feedback, utilizing VMD to showcase molecular point group files and visually represent molecular symmetry elements is beneficial for students in comprehending related concepts. This resource can serve as a valuable tool for teaching symmetry, offering interactivity, visual appeal, and offline accessibility, allowing for flexible use across different times and locations.\n\nReference\nJ.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Uncertainty Principle is usually discussed twice in a Quantum Chemistry course. The first discussion is a “pre-wave function” explanation that occurs before students know about wave functions, but do know the de Broglie hypothesis. The second description of the Uncertainty Principle is “post-wave function”, i.e., after students have learned about wave functions, operators, and expectation values. The more common pre-wave function explanations of the Uncertainty Principle can lead students to believe that the Uncertainty Principle sets limits upon what can be measured in the lab. This is the “measurement view” of the Uncertainty Principle. The Uncertainty Principle says something much deeper than this; particles do not possess some properties solely because of their wave nature. This is the “particle-centric view” of the Uncertainty Principle. We show that the Uncertainty Principle can be explained from the preferred particle-centric view when students only know about the de Broglie wavelength and basic statistics. To accompany this pre-wave function discussion of the Uncertainty Principle, we have designed an interactive Module that students can use to visualize the Uncertainty Principle from the particle viewpoint. We also describe a way to explain the Uncertainty Principle, which is complementary to the pre-wave function discussion, after the students know about wave functions, using the same elementary statistical analysis used in the pre-wave function presentation. We have designed a second interactive Module that students can use to visualize the Uncertainty Principle when particles are described by complex wave functions.\n\nReference\nClara Snow and Michael Messina, Journal of Chemical Education Article ASAP, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00583\nKEYWORDS: \n\n\n\n\nReuse©2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is this experiment about?\nStudents identify and count valence electrons in their first chemistry courses. Experimental data, such as ionization energies, supports the concept of valence electrons, but quantum mechanical calculations provide a richer context for the distinction between valence and core electrons. Through guided calculations on atoms and diatomic molecules, students develop the valence electron concept for atoms, build a potential energy curve for a diatomic molecule, and show how valence molecular orbitals arise from their calculated atomic orbitals. Students should be familiar with atomic orbitals at the general chemistry level.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nStudents predict how characteristics of valence electrons differ from core electrons and then calculate and examine atomic orbital energies for the first and second row atoms, refining their list of characteristics. Students turn to a diatomic molecule and examine how its molecular electronic energy varies with internuclear distance, developing their understanding of chemical bonding. They then perform calculations on first and second row homonuclear diatomic molecules, building molecular orbital diagrams. This experiment develops refined concepts of valence electrons and chemical bonding, built from student data. The full experiment typically requires two three-hour lab periods to complete.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\nCalculations can be done on ChemCompute https://chemcompute.org/, the WebMO demo server https://www.webmo.net/demo, or a package of the instructor’s choice. Microsoft Excel and Google Sheet templates are available in which students can build atomic and molecular orbital energy diagrams from their data.\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nStudents connect their general chemistry concepts of atomic and molecular electronic structure to the more rigorous quantum mechanical calculations. They see some of their original concepts confirmed by the calculations and develop a refined description of valence and core electrons. They also explore how to use these types of calculations in determining bond length, providing a more accurate foundation for qualitative discussions of potential energy curves and surfaces.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents develop a hypothesis about the distinction between core and valence electrons. They engage in decision-making and experimental design: The class assigns calculations to student teams for reproducibility and to refine results. They bring the results together as the teams interact with each other to build conclusions. Students use graphical models with the numerical data and atomic and molecular orbital visualizations to process information. They can demonstrate their understanding of the developed concepts through post-experiment questions that explore homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules.\n\n\nReference\nLead author: Melissa Reeves, Tuskeegee University\nView student handout\nThe Instructor’s Handbook with implementation details, sample data, and expected answers is available through the POGIL-PCL project.\nHighlight author: Rob Whitnell\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Experiments that explore quantum principles while utilizing and reinforcing previous synthesis skills are excellent for engaging students and promoting the interconnected nature of chemistry. This experiment utilizes sophomore-level organic synthesis techniques to have students produce their own meso substituted porphyrins. The UV–vis absorption spectrum of the porphyrins is then collected and using the lowest π* ← π transition energy, the size of the conjugated circular π system and the length of a conjugated C–C bond can be calculated using the quantum particle-on-a-ring wave functions and energies. The model slightly overestimates the circumference of the ring and the C–C bond length. Students can then see and rationalize that there are clear molecular orbital considerations and substitution effects that cause these overestimations. With the ability to synthesize multiple substituted porphyrins and potentially insert metal cations, as well, this experiment offers a flexible and engaging way for physical chemistry students to synthesize their own molecules in the service of exploring quantum theory.\n\nReference\nCourtney H.

    "text": "Sensemaking is an important way of learning and engaging in science. Research has shown that sensemaking activities, such as questioning, hypothesizing, and model building, are pivotal in developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in science education. This paper investigates the role of computational simulations in facilitating sensemaking in chemistry education, specifically examining how these simulations can sustain the sensemaking process. Through a detailed case study in a physical chemistry course, we explore the interplay between students’ real-world experiences, theoretical knowledge, and computational simulations. This analysis reveals that computational simulations, by providing interactive and visual representations of chemical phenomena, can create a conducive environment for sensemaking, where students actively engage in exploring and resolving conceptual uncertainties. Based on these results, we argue that computational tools, when effectively integrated into educational settings, can facilitate sensemaking in science education.\n\nReference\nHaraldsrud and Odden, Chem.

The following project is for an independent study student or an undergraduate researcher desiring training in theoretical chemistry. The C5 symmetry of the pentafluoroxenate(IV) anion showcases that “bonds form when orbitals overlap.” The project guides students to see how number theory is incorporated into molecular structures and the nature of shapes. Additionally, [XeF5]− has minimal d-orbital contributions, so the student does not require previous experience with d-orbital splitting. The qualitative analysis of the pentagonal planar, D5h pentafluoroxenate(IV) anion [XeF5]− was performed using group theory and the projection operator method. The computational approach used a population analysis of [XeF5]− to obtain the electronic structure.\n\nReference\nKevin P. Freddo and I. F.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy is widely used in undergraduate chemistry. Despite its ubiquitous use, very little research has been conducted on how students develop understanding or competency with this spectroscopic tool. To begin addressing this gap, we present results from an exploratory cross-sectional qualitative investigation of how postsecondary chemistry students reason about UV/vis spectroscopy. We used a phenomenographic construct modeling approach to characterize different ways learners experience the phenomenon of UV/vis spectroscopy. We have organized these various ways hierarchically according to sophistication. These levels were distinct from each other based on how students explained light interacting with molecules to give rise to spectral peaks. The lowest level reasoning showed that students link spectral peaks to individual atoms within molecules. In contrast, the highest level of understanding offered a mechanism of how light specifically interacts with molecules to give rise to spectral peaks by activating resources about specific electronic transitions. These results provide a starting point for a working model of students’ reasoning. We view this as a developmental model to show how students can progress from atom-level information to offering a mechanistic explanation of how light interacts with molecules, which can translate to other light–matter interaction-based phenomena.\n\nReference\nHaiyan Al Fulaiti, Amelie Cole, Morgan Balabanoff, and Alena Moon, Journal of Chemical Education Article ASAP, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00120\n\n\n\n\nReuse©2024 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc."

Despite their importance in understanding luminescent properties and photochemical reaction mechanisms, nonradiative transitions are rarely given more than a qualitative overview in undergraduate and even graduate physical chemistry curricula. To supplement the coverage of nonradiative transition topics, we provide here a set of active learning exercises to help students develop an intuitive understanding of the factors that determine the rate of nonradiative transitions. We start by outlining the theoretical background through the formulation of the Franck-Condon factor and its relation to the rate of nonradiative transition. We then introduce three teaching modules, with associated MATLAB and Python codes, to explore how 1) the excited state nuclear displacement, 2) the electronic energy gap between excited and ground state, and 3) the excited/ground state vibrational mode frequencies affect the magnitude of the Franck-Condon factor and thereby the rate of nonradiative transitions. The wavefunction overlap plots that accompany all teaching modules provide direct visualization of the effect of input parameters on the magnitude of Franck-Condon overlap integral.\n\nReference\nZheng X, Drummer MC, Russell TA, Gozem S, Glusac KD.

    "text": "A flipped classroom is typically one where some of the instruction occurs asynchronously prior to the scheduled synchronous meeting between students and the instructor. Since 2000, they have gained substantial popularity especially in STEM fields where they have been shown to have increased exam scores and reduce the number of students who fail. In the university setting, many of these studies have been performed in lower division courses. Very few studies have been conducted in senior physical chemistry courses resulting in very little data being collected on this instructional technique at this level. The purpose of this study is to assess student outcomes when flipped classroom techniques are implemented in a senior physical chemistry course. In our flipped classroom, students were expected to watch lecture videos and complete preparation exercises created by the authors prior to coming to class. Then in class, a just in time teaching model was employed prior to students working in groups to complete activities created by the authors. Seven quizzes were performed individually and in groups while three midterms and a cumulative final exam were performed individually. Grade, student opinion questionnaires and survey data collected over seven semesters from Fall 2017 to Spring 2022 will be presented. Our findings indicate that there was only one semester out of seven where the average GPA of the students was significantly higher than the control class which was taught in a traditional lecture style. According to student surveys, the students focused on the importance of the preparation questions and dismissed the importance of completing activity/homework problems given that preparation activities were assigned credit while homework was not. Given that the in-class activities/homework questions resembled the material in assessments like quizzes, midterms and final exams, while preparation questions were scaffolded formative problems meant to introduce students to the concepts to be studied during the synchronous lecture, an important link between course concepts and material on summative assessments was not made. Future changes to address this issue will be discussed as well as how COVID-19 affected students during the pandemic as well as flipped classroom instruction.\n\nReference\nT. M. Gomez, C.

Empirical investigations show that simulation and (interactive) visualizations can support students by offering new possibilities for investigating connections and direct effects of parameter changes. Therefore, this article introduces a digital and interactive learning environment that addresses students’ learning difficulties to facilitate the understanding of crucial 1H NMR background knowledge. The SpinDrops Learning Environment (SDLE) covers practically useful, basic concepts for interpreting a 1H NMR spectrum from a theoretical point of view. It includes new interactive visualizations and a dynamic and realistically simulated ppm-spectrum. To evaluate the role and influence of interactivity by parameter control regarding students’ learning processes and conceptual understanding, we designed two SDLE versions differing in the degree of interactivity and dynamics. We then asked N = 50 students to work with the learning environment in a pre-post study with questionnaires on affective constructs and a 1H NMR knowledge test on conceptual understanding. N = 12 students additionally took part in a think-aloud study. The results showed that students benefit from learning with the SDLE as their conceptual understanding and NMR-related interest, self-efficacy, and estimated knowledge increase significantly. Although the SDLE showed significantly positive effects on students’ learning results and processes, the difference in the degree of interactivity and dynamics inside the software only had a small impact, as revealed in the quantitative and qualitative data.\n\nReference\nD.

    "text": "Smart Worksheets were introduced in 2017 into a second-year undergraduate chemical kinetics course (UK) and were available to students from the start of the course until the summer examination (ca. 3 months in duration). Several metrics strongly suggest that the introduction of the Smart Worksheets has a very positive impact on student understanding. For example, students who attended workshops completed twice as many questions as in previous years, with some completing them all. Students who attended workshops were much better prepared for these workshop activities, and because students had used the Smart Worksheets before the workshops, the tutor had information on what students understood and did not understand. Therefore, workshop tutors were able to prepare workshops that targeted specific needs. Questions asked in workshops and in an online forum showed more higher-order thinking than in previous years. Student feedback highlighted the usefulness of the Smart Worksheets (e.g., the instant feedback), and examination scores showed a statistically significant difference (95% confidence level) between the mean score for those who used the Smart Worksheets (larger than) compared with those who did not. This study suggests that Smart Worksheets can have a significant positive impact on student cognition, assessment (here examination) performance, enjoyment, and enthusiasm for a highly quantitative course.\n\nReference\nDudley E.

By using numerical approaches to solve the Schrödinger equation this approach can be applied to a broad range of potentials relevant to a number of different experimental techniques such as vibrational spectroscopy and quantum tunneling. By modifying the generated 3D models appropriately, without changing their overall descriptive character, further improvements in the representation of the underlying potential surface and the associated wave functions can be achieved.

The authors assessed the current educational landscape against standards set by leading accreditation bodies, the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the Royal Australian Chemical Institute. A systematic research method allowed comprehensive coverage of peer reviewed literature using two databases: Web of Science and SciFinder. A total of 511 papers were included in this review, and 245 highly cited articles were classified into five themes: students as learners, curriculum, instructional material, educational innovation, and context. Using these themes, it was possible to find the major implications of research in tertiary chemistry teaching within the literature for the five-year period. Key findings show that experiential learning through in-person laboratory activities is affirmed. Virtual resources developed during the pandemic, however, were mostly moved post pandemic to prelaboratory or complementary activities. Integration of innovative technologies and games into teaching can improve student engagement and learning, but also presents opportunities, such as generative artificial intelligence for the development of student critical thinking skills and communication skills. Students valued learning with authentic examples or big-picture contexts, like climate change or systems thinking. An emergent theme was improvements in inclusive chemistry education. This embracing of technology alongside traditional methods, and the rise of interdisciplinary approaches and inclusivity, equips graduates with the skills necessary for successful careers in chemistry.\n\nReference\nWendy A.

One such area is the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to chemistry. Here we describe a new activity that applies ML regression analysis to the common physical chemistry laboratory experiment on the electronic absorption spectra of cyanine dyes. In the classic version of this experiment, students collect experimental spectra and interpret them using the Kuhn free electron model, based on the quantum mechanical particle-in-a-box (PIB). Our new computational activity has students train regression models of increasing complexity to predict the wavelength of maximum absorption for different cyanine dyes using a set of 13 molecular features. In addition, the activity introduces methods for evaluating and interpreting regression models. Ultimately, students are prompted to use their regression analysis results to generate hypotheses for what molecular properties underlie cyanine dye absorption, leading them naturally to the PIB model. In this report, we provide a dataset, reference code implementations in Mathematica and Python notebooks, and an example lab protocol with an introduction to cyanine dyes and the ML techniques. This activity can be completed in a single 3-hour lab period by upper-level undergraduate students with relatively little prior programming experience. Although intended to complement the experimental measurement of cyanine dye spectra, this activity can also be performed on its own; alternatively, it can form the basis of more involved projects in a computational chemistry or machine learning course.\n\nReference\nThrall E, Martinez Lopez F, Egg T, Lee SE, Schrier J, Zhao Y.

    "text": "The partitioning of a chemical between two immiscible solvents can be performed in a stoppered cuvette. Since the sample remains intact during the spectroscopic analysis, it can be subjected to additional extraction solvent, so further data can be obtained. This technique has the potential to save time and money and can dramatically minimize chemical waste. The mathematics of successive partitioning are developed, so that the spectral absorption can be written as a function of the volume of the extracting solvent, and the distribution equilibrium constant KD can be determined by least-squares. The solvatochromic dye Brooker’s merocyanine and methylene blue were partitioned between octanol and water in a cuvette; the data yielded reasonable fits; the values of KD were 0.026 and 0.054, respectively. The technique was applied to the acid–base indicator methyl orange; while the data is reproducible, the fit of the data indicates some systematic bias, presumably because additional acid–base equilibria come into play.\n\nReference\nCarl Salter, Rebecca Skibo, Alexandra E.

    "text": "The most abundant nuclides in the cosmos have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. These include He-4, C-12, N-14, O-16, Ne-20, Mg-24, Si-28, and S-32, which together comprise 99.5% of ordinary polynucleonic matter. These are the most kinetically resilient (stable) nuclides within the highly exothermic reaction conditions of cosmic nucleosynthesis. This paper analyzes the relationship between a nuclide’s equinucleonic (Z=N) composition and its relative cosmic abundance. Structural symmetry emerges as a sensitive and specific predictor of superabundance within a proposed alternating nucleon model. The model derives from the proton’s radius (r = 0.8414 fm), the hadron’s prolate shape (from the transition to the proton’s first excited state, the ∆+(1232) resonance), and the separation distance between a pair of bound nucleons (≈ 0.8 fm, from the nucleon-nucleon potential). Various nucleon geometries were considered for each nuclide, with preference given to structures having optimal numbers of stable proton-neutron short-range interactions and whose model radii (derived from the regular polygon radius formula) best correlate with experimental charge radii (r(31)=.98, p&lt;.001). Remarkably, the best-fit solutions for the eight superabundant Z=N nuclides categorically demonstrate bilateral structural symmetry, in which neutrons reflect protons on opposite sides of a bisecting chiral plane. Conversely, when an element’s stable isotopes are compared, the best-fit structures in which nucleon symmetry is not possible (generally because proton and neutron numbers are unequal) are less abundant by ≈ 2 orders of magnitude. Symmetry is ubiquitous in nature, and the proposed alternating nucleon model is consistent with the axiom that structural symmetry confers structural stability.\n\nReference\nWalsh R., ChemRxiv. 2024; doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-2mrns\nThis content is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-ND 4.0"

How we visualize these bonds further primes students to select one model over another. Previous research has targeted misconceptions of the chemical bond, but how they interact and evolve remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we examine the diversity of conceptions in bachelor’s chemistry students who have started to learn about quantum chemistry. We present results of a thematic analysis of data produced by bachelor students at different stages in their studies while interacting with a chemical simulation triangulated with a metaphor analysis of interviews with students taking a quantum chemistry lecture. We found that the chemical bond was largely conceptualized either as a rigid entity or in relation to energy in writing and informally metaphorically as community. We argue that while these conceptualizations are valid models, the students struggle to understand the contextual dependency and the plurality of different models.\n\nReference\nC. H.

Students then apply the particle-on-a-line model to their experimental data, specifically focusing on refining the meaning of the line length.

Despite the ubiquity of light-based tools in modern science, students often find it difficult to comprehend light and light-matter interactions. A portable spectrometer is utilized to record the fluorescence spectra of various lasers and molecular samples in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Three different wavelength laser sources are utilized to excite the molecular samples. Students record the experimental emission spectra from the lasers as well as from the provided inorganic and organic samples, and analyze the resulting spectra for fluorescence wavelength, spectral peak widths, and intensity. These experimental results help students understand and appreciate the quantum theory of spectroscopy. Several conceptual and reasoning difficulties among students in relating the emission spectra to energy levels of atoms and molecules are reduced by these laboratory activities and exercises. Furthermore, these laboratory exercises may stimulate research interest in students as they look forward in their careers.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Thermodynamics forms an important part of the chemistry and chemical engineering curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Over the years, the importance of statistical mechanics and molecular simulations in the curriculum has increased, especially at the graduate level. Given this shift, in this work, we utilize the microcanonical ensemble, which is typically considered to be intractable, and show that it is helpful to employ it as a pedagogical tool that demonstrates the consistency of microcanonical statistical mechanics with the combined first and second law of thermodynamics. We start with Boltzmann’s entropy formula and use differential calculus to establish that dE=TdS - PdV for an isolated, nonideal fluid in an arbitrary number of dimensions, with a constant number of particles (N), volume (V), and energy (E), and with temperature T, pressure P, and entropy S. To this end, we write the partition function for an isolated monoatomic fluid. Further, we derive the average of the inverse kinetic energy, which appears in the formulation of the combined first and second law, and show that it is equal to the inverse of the average kinetic energy, thus introducing the system’s temperature (T). Subsequently, we obtain an expression for the pressure (P) of a system involving many-body interactions and introduce the system pressure in the combined first and second law via Clausius’s virial theorem. We discuss how intermolecular interactions affect the entropy and pressure of a thermodynamic system. Overall, we inform the derivation of the fundamental thermodynamic relationship dE=TdS-PdV using an isolated (microcanonical) system, thereby providing deeper insight into equilibrium statistical thermodynamics. Indeed, we demonstrated that this material resulted in favorable learning outcomes when taught as a 1.5-hour lecture. Accordingly, the material presented here may be incorporated into graduate-level courses on statistical mechanics and/or molecular simulations in various disciplines, including chemistry and physics, as well as chemical, materials, and mechanical engineering.\n\nReference\nGovind Rajan A.

This dry lab has students explore the NIST Chemistry Webbook database to examine a variety of organic molecules. Students discover that they must look at multiple structural properties to obtain a full understanding of the melting point behavior. Students should be familiar with concepts of enthalpy and entropy and a basic sense of how they apply to molecular structure.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nStudents tend to have a preconception that melting is very similar to boiling—that is, melting point is determined exclusively by IMFs. In this experiment, students consider various sets of molecules designed to allow them to discover that they will need to take into account additional factors. Students will predict the effects of flexibility, polarity, molecular size, and symmetry on melting point, and explain how these parameters affect the enthalpy and entropy of fusion. Students work together to research values and model data, and they periodically report out to the class. Note that this experiment is a dry lab activity–students find data on the NIST Chemistry Webbook (and also use computational modeling software to visualize the molecules). In post-experiment questions, students can apply what they’ve learned to design molecules with high or low melting points. The experiment can be completed in as little as one lab period, including some work outside of class.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\nElectronic devices with access to the internet (to look up data on NIST Chemistry Webbook).

Here, we use a large dataset of student interactions with online courseware to investigate the details of this link between math and chemistry. The activities in the courseware are labeled against a list of knowledge components (KCs) covered by the content, and student interactions are tracked over a full semester of general chemistry at a range of institutions. Logistic regression is used to model student performance as a function of the number of opportunities a student has taken to engage with a particular KC. This regression analysis generates estimates of both the initial knowledge and the learning rate for each student and each KC. Consistent with results from other domains, the initial knowledge varies substantially across students, but the learning rate is nearly the same for all students. The role of math is investigated by labeling each KC with the level of math involved. The overwhelming result from regressions based on these labels is that only the initial knowledge varies strongly across students and across the level of math involved in a particular topic. The student learning rate is nearly independent of both the level of math involved in a KC and the prior mathematical preparation of an individual student.

This hierarchy enables systematic implementation of AI in practical chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, catalytic technologies, environmental control, and other key areas. The first level contributes to increased efficiency in a wide range of tasks: in production, research and education, preparation of documentation, patent and market research, support of regulatory procedures, automated preparation of analytical data, as well as staff training and knowledge transfer within the organization. The second level provides in-depth data analysis, reduced R&D timelines, and technology scaling. The third level opens up opportunities for breakthrough solutions, including autonomous design of new molecules, processes, and materials.

Chem. Educ., 2025, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c01287\nThe increasing relevance of generative artificial intelligence in our everyday life prompts educational researchers to carefully assess science-learning experiences using this new technology. In this study, prompting strategies of preservice chemistry teachers were evaluated through the duration of a semester in several course settings. A course was developed that addresses the use of GenAI in contexts like problem solving in chemistry and teaching and learning chemistry and had the students individually work on a chemistry-related project. The course instructs the students in a specific prompting technique, the 5S prompting framework, to foster their prompting skills. During the semester and for a period after the semester, approximately 1600 prompts of students given to GenAI were collected via a custom-made interface that allowed researchers to see students’ prompts. The analysis of these conversations shows that students incorporated the prompting strategies they were taught in their conversations and interactions with GenAI during and after the semester. In this publication, the 5S prompting framework and its implementation in students’ prompting habits as well as implications for teaching about GenAI in chemistry-specific contexts are discussed.\n\n\nConsidering the Ethics of Large Machine Learning Models in the Chemical Sciences\nSpotte-Smith, Evan Walter Clark, ChemRxiv. 2025; doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ct5k8-v2. This content is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.\nFoundation models, including large language models, vision-language models, and similar large-scale machine learning tools, are quickly becoming ubiquitous in society and in the professional world. Chemical practitioners are not immune to the appeal of foundation models, nor are they immune to the many risks and harms that these models introduce. In this work, I present the first analysis of foundation models using the combined lens of scientific ethics and chemical professional ethics. I find that general-purpose generative foundation models are in many ways incompatible with the moral practice of chemistry, though there are fewer ethical problems with chemistry-specific foundation models. My discussion concludes with an examination of how the harm associated with foundation models can be minimized and further poses a set of serious lingering questions for chemical practitioners and scientific ethicists.\n\n\nAI+Chemistry Education in Top Chinese University: Embedding Computational Thinking into Curriculum\nWang R. ChemRxiv. 2025; doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-8kh8t This content is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.\nIntegrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) into chemistry education requires shifting from treating AI as an opaque tool to cultivating students’ computational thinking—the ability to deconstruct algorithmic logic and apply it to solve chemical problems. Based on pre-curriculum investigation and analysis, this paper proposes an innovative interdisciplinary teaching framework that bridges AGI theory with chemistry education through computational thinking. By employing multidimensional strategies such as embodied cognition, metacognitive approaches, and phenomenon-based learning, we empower students to deconstruct the “black box” of AI algorithms and develop innovative domain-specific solutions. Pilot implementations demonstrate significant improvements in students’ understanding and application of AI for chemical problem-solving. Capitalizing on this advantage, the course has been included as a core required course in compulsory Chemical Engineering + AI undergaduation program of Tanwei College, Tsinghua University. This approach not only equips students with technical proficiency but also cultivates a generation of AI+Chemistry capable of co-designing AGI systems to address real-world challenges.\n\n\nA Missed Opportunity for No-Code Chatbots? Current Challenges in Publicly Available Chemistry GPTs\nMartin Sigot Sebastian Tassoti, J. Chem. Educ., 2025, doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c01552\nWith the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and ChatGPT, individualization of learning pathways was discussed in the educational context. One way to achieve customization is the use of specialized versions of ChatGPT–so-called GPTs. Those GPTs are publicly available and used daily by thousands of people worldwide. In this work, we analyze the current market of chemistry-specialized GPTs in the OpenAI GPT ‘store’. We identify common shortcomings, such as unnecessary activation of features like DALL-E, overly positive use of terms like ‘expert’ or ‘teacher’ and the inclusion of copyrighted material. To highlight the urgency of well-designed GPTs in chemistry education, we analyze the most used chemistry-specific GPT in more detail to discuss further problems with GPTs. In summary, we advocate a collaborative effort within the chemistry education community to develop robust and publicly available GPTs. Future research might benefit from a focus on creating and refining these GPTs and exploring their impact on learning in both secondary and tertiary educational settings.\n\n\nInvestigating the Uses and Impacts of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Chemistry Education\nJournal of Chemical Education Virtual Special Issue\nGuest Editors: Elizabeth Yuriev, Monash University, Australia; Donald J.

Supundrika Subasinghe, Simon G. GersibNeal P. Mankad, J. Chem. Educ., 2025, doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c01498\nLarge language models (LLMs) are positioned to transform how students interact with data in classroom and laboratory settings, both now and in the future. The integration of LLMs into chemical curricula, if done effectively, may improve student equity and learning outcomes and provide an alternative approach to data analysis alongside traditional methods. One of the key strengths of LLMs is their ability to efficiently summarize large data sets and transform them into understandable forms. Here we focus on use of LLMs to process quantitative data and make high-quality data plots without relying exclusively on spreadsheet skills. Specifically, we tested the ability of OpenAI’s ChatGPT to plot Walsh diagrams relevant to an ongoing laboratory experiment conducted in an undergraduate inorganic chemistry course.\n\n\nDiscussing the Ethics of Professional AI Use in Undergraduate Chemistry Courses\nEmily F. Ruff, Jennifer M. O. Zemke, J. Chem.

We designed and piloted two exercises using articles from the popular press to introduce students to professional uses of AI in chemistry and related areas. Using student writing and follow-up assignments, we find that students are optimistic that AI will advance these fields but are also concerned that human labor and ideas should be protected. We close with suggestions for other instructors designing similar assignments.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence in Chemistry Research─Implications for Teaching and Learning\nSandra Berber, Mathea Brückner, Nikolai Maurer, Johannes Huwer, J. Chem. Educ., 2025, doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c01033\nDespite its growing relevance, the discussion of AI as a tool in research in (secondary) chemistry education remains limited. To address this gap, a review of AI applications in chemical and chemistry-related research was first carried out. Based on this review a workshop for pre- and in-service chemistry teachers was conducted to provide an initial overview of AI applications in scientific research. The workshop introduced key areas such as retrosynthesis, protein structure prediction, image processing, and autonomous laboratories, fostering awareness of AI’s role in scientific innovation. Participating secondary education science teachers reported an increased familiarity with AI applications and expressed intentions to incorporate these topics into their teaching.\n\n\nLet Us Not Squander the Affordances of LLMs for the Sake of Expedience: Using Retrieval Augmented Generative AI Chatbots to Support and Evaluate Student Reasoning\nMelanie M.

Many, but not all, students are using GenAI for homework and assignments, which means that we need to provide equitable access for all students to AI systems that can support and enhance their learning. At the same time, we need to think carefully about just what we want teaching and learning to look like as GenAI systems become readily available. Here we propose that “business as usual” is not a responsible option. Although chatbots can readily answer questions, produce summaries of content, and make the process of education more efficient, there is scant evidence that such time saving is effective, and indeed, it is important that we not allow the use of GenAI systems to circumvent or undermine the learning process. The availability of so-called Retrieval Augmented Generative (RAG) AI systems allows us to expand what we expect students to know and do, by 1) supporting instructors in the design of more complex tasks (that can, for example, elicit evidence of three-dimensional learning (3DL)), 2) supporting students as they reason through such scaffolded tasks, and 3) by evaluating student responses, individually and in aggregate. We present examples of each of these affordances with the associated training materials and bot personas, along with caveats about their use.\n\n\nUsing Generative AI Systems for Critical Thinking Engagement in an Advanced Chemistry Course: A Case Study\nPence, et. al., J. Chem. Educ. 2024, doi: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00242\nA series of critical thinking assignments was created for students in an advanced chemistry course to interact with and evaluate generative AI (GenAI) systems. Students explored GenAI’s facility with producing summaries of C&EN articles, analyzing titration data, and closely reading literature articles. For each assignment, the students evaluated the output using a critical thinking exercise and presented their results using written reports. The students found GenAI to be effective at summarizing news articles, although it demonstrated inaccuracies in mathematical calculations and produced mixed results in answering technical questions based on specific literature articles. The assignments provided valuable practice for students’ critical thinking skills.\n\n\nEnhancing AI Responses in Chemistry: Integrating Text Generation, Image Creation, and Image Interpretation through Different Levels of Prompts\nWilton J. D. Nascimento Júnior, Carla Morais, Gildo Girotto Júnior, J. Chem. Ed., 2024, doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00230\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence technologies can potentially transform education, benefiting teachers and students. This study evaluated various GAIs, including ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, Bing Chat, Adobe Firefly, Leonardo.AI, and DALL-E, focusing on textual and imagery content. Utilizing initial, intermediate, and advanced prompts, we aim to simulate GAI responses tailored to users with varying levels of knowledge. We aim to investigate the possibilities of integrating content from Chemistry Teaching. The systems presented responses appropriate to the scientific consensus for textual generation, but they revealed alternative chemical content conceptions. In terms of the interpretation of chemical system representations, only ChatGPT 4.0 accurately identified the content in all of the images. In terms of image production, even with more advanced prompts and subprompts, Generative Artificial Intelligence still presents difficulties in content production. The use of prompts involving the Python language promoted an improvement in the images produced. In general, we can consider content production as support for chemistry teaching, but only with more advanced prompts do the answers tend to present fewer errors. The importance of previously understanding chemistry concepts and systems’ functioning is noted.\n\n\nChatGPT as an Instructor’s Assistant for Generating and Scoring Exams\nAlberto A. Fernández, Margarita López-Torres, Jesús J. Fernández, Digna Vázquez-García J. Chem. Educ. 2024, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00231, CC-BY\nThis study assessed ChatGPT’s proficiency in responding to questions from University Entrance Exams typically administered to senior secondary students. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT version 4.0 consistently outperformed students, achieving higher average scores across exams from the past four years. However, it still committed errors in about 20% of its responses. Despite this, ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated a robust capability to comprehend and produce natural language within a chemical context. Consequently, by applying diverse prompt engineering techniques, this AI was able to create short-answer questions and numerical problems that closely mimic the format and conceptual content of University Entrance Exams. We also confirmed that ChatGPT 4.0 could grade exams, showing a significant correlation with scores given by human evaluators but lower than that among human graders. This discrepancy and other practical considerations limit its application in grading exams.\n\n\nExploring the Concept of Valence and the Nature of Science via Generative Artificial Intelligence and General Chemistry Textbooks\nRebecca M. Jones, Eva-Maria Rudler, Conner Preston, J. Chem. Educ., 2024, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00271\nThis paper explores historical and modern perspectives of the concept of valence in the context of collegiate general chemistry and draws comparisons to responses from generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools such as ChatGPT. A fundamental concept in chemistry, valence in the early and mid-20th century was primarily defined as the “combining capacity” of atoms. Twenty-first century textbooks do not include this historical definition but rather use valence as an adjective to modify other nouns, e.g., valence electron or valence orbital. To explore these different perspectives in other information sources that could be used by students, we used a systematic series of prompts about valence to analyze the responses from ChatGPT, Bard, Liner, and ChatSonic from September and December 2023. Our findings show the historical definition is very common in responses to prompts which use valence or valency as a noun but less common when prompts include valence as an adjective. Regarding this concept, the state-of-the-art genAI tools are more consistent with textbooks from the 1950s than modern collegiate general chemistry textbooks. These findings present an opportunity for chemistry educators to observe and discuss with students the nature of science and how our understanding of chemistry changes. Including implications for educators, we present an example activity that may be deployed in general chemistry classes.\n\n\nStudent Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence Utility in the Introductory Chemistry Classroom\nMendez, James D., J. Chem. Educ., 2024, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00075\nThis study investigates student perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in an introductory chemistry course. Students engaged with AI chatbots of their choice to correct missed exam questions, revealing overall positive attitudes toward their usefulness. Despite this positive perception, the study shows a disconnect between the overall media portrayal of AI in academia and how actual students use it. Only a small number of students had used AI before this activity. This study highlights the need for training on responsible AI use to address ongoing ethical concerns over the misuse of these systems and to get ahead of future issues.\n\n\nLarge Language Models are Catalyzing Chemistry Education\nDu Y, Duan C, Bran A, Sotnikova A, Qu Y, Kulik H, et al., ChemRxiv. 2024; doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h722v\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in general problem-solving and been shown to improve productivity in certain domains. Thanks to their flexibility, recent work has leveraged them for diverse scientific applications, ranging from predictive modeling, scientific Q&A, and even as autonomous agents towards automation in chemistry. The democratization of high-quality chemistry education faces several challenges, including heterogeneity among sub-fields, limited access to personalized guidance, and an uneven distribution of resources. Additionally, hands-on laboratory experiments, a crucial component of chemistry education, are difficult to scale due to inherent safety risks that necessitate close supervision. We propose that LLMs can help overcome these obstacles by providing scalable solutions that tailor educational content to individual needs, enhancing the overall learning experience. In this perspective, we discuss how LLMs can catalyze chemistry education across multiple dimensions, from preparing and delivering lectures and tackling guidance in both wet lab and computational experiments, to re-thinking evaluation methodologies in the classroom. We also discuss some potential risks of this technology, such as the possibility of generating inaccurate or biased content, and emphasize the need for further development to ensure the successful integration of LLMs in the chemistry classroom.\n\n\nUsing ChatGPT to Support Lesson Planning for the Historical Experiments of Thomson, Millikan, and Rutherford\nTed M. Clark, Matthew Fhaner, Matthew Stoltzfus, and Matt Scott Queen, J. Chem. Ed., 2024, doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00200\nFour General Chemistry instructors investigated the use of ChatGPT-4 to improve their lessons plans for the historical experiments of Thomson, Millikan, and Rutherford. The instructors varied in their prior knowledge for these experiments and their initial lessons addressed somewhat different learning objectives. This led to different conversations with the chatbot as the instructors used the resource in different ways and discussed topics they each found relevant. The output from ChatGPT-4 was robust and each instructor identified ways it could be used to improve their instruction. The chatbot was able to accomplish instructional tasks these instructors found useful, such as outlining a lesson plan, recommending resources, discussing instructional strategies, describing calculations, offering explanations for different levels of leaners, and generating assessments. A limitation was its ability create images or visual aids the instructors found useful. Overall, these instructors found the chatbot could support, but not replace, an instructor in a course like General Chemistry.\n\n\nStudents’ Experience of a ChatGPT Enabled Final Exam in a Non-Majors Chemistry Course\nMorgan J. Clark, Micke Reynders, and Thomas A. Holme, Journal of Chemical Education, 2024, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00161\nIn the field of education, ChatGPT has become a topic of debate for its usefulness as a learning tool. This article focuses on non-science majors’ (n = 29) perceptions of a ChatGPT enabled final exam, where, prior to the exam, students wrote papers on science and sustainability and, during the final exam, students were asked to compare their paper to one produced on the same topic by ChatGPT. Thus, the underlying chemistry, its broader impacts, and connection to sustainability and writing styles were compared. Students’ perceptions were analyzed through a developed coding framework that enabled the visualization of emerging themes. The most common themes revealed that students believed the ChatGPT essay did not read as “human-like”, used more intricate words, and often did not include enough science to support its arguments. Students also noted that their essays provided more chemistry details and were easier to read as they focused on connecting chemistry concepts to their essay topic as well as sustainable policies and practices. Students were impressed, however, by ChatGPT’s ability to discuss various sustainability solutions, policies, and practices. The final exam inspired self-reflection for the students to improve not only their writing but also their analysis of sustainability responses. Overall, students rated the comparative activity as a final exam to be favorable and remarked on the importance of analyzing AI generated work for the future of learning.\n\n\nCan ChatGPT Enhance Chemistry Laboratory Teaching? Using Prompt Engineering to Enable AI in Generating Laboratory Activities\nJosé Luís Araújo and Isabel Saúde, Journal of Chemical Education, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00745\nThe rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is profoundly shaping our society. Among various AI tools, ChatGPT stands out for its user-friendly nature and wide accessibility to the public. However, despite their countless potential benefits, these tools also face significant challenges, especially in sensitive areas like Education. In this publication, we conduct a prompt engineering essay with ChatGPT to understand the potential and challenges of this tool in designing new, high-quality chemistry laboratory activities. We aimed to assess its performance in proposing scientifically and pedagogically suitable protocols for chemistry laboratory activities based on the 11th-grade Portuguese curriculum. The initial exploratory essay was conducted to fine-tune the prompt, followed by the analysis of proposals for the five mandatory laboratory activities in this subject. ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to interpret and reproduce the specialized symbolic language of chemistry, effectively conceptualizing problems and laboratory activities in a clear and understandable manner for a broader audience (i.e., chemistry students). However, it is crucial to highlight the scientific-pedagogical limitations concerning the accuracy and appropriateness of the proposed laboratory activities, particularly in terms of safety and sustainability. Therefore, the use of AI in education should be approached critically and reflectively. While AI holds immense potential to transform the dynamics of teaching and learning, the role and expertise of the Chemistry teacher remain of the utmost importance to ensure the scientific and pedagogical quality of Chemistry classes.\n\n\nComment on “Comparing the Performance of College Chemistry Students with ChatGPT for Calculations Involving Acids and Bases”\nJoshua Schrier, Journal of Chemical Education, 2024, 10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00058\nIn a recent paper in this Journal ( J. Chem. Educ. 2023, 100, 3934−3944), Clark et al. evaluated the performance of the GPT-3.5 large language model (LLM) on ten undergraduate pH calculation problems. They reported that GPT-3.5 gave especially poor results for salt and titration problems, returning the correct results only 10% and 0% of the time, respectively, and that, despite a correct application of heuristics, the LLM made mathematical errors and used flawed strategies. However, these problems are partially mitigated using the more advanced GPT-4 model and entirely corrected using simple prompting and calculator tool use patterns demonstrated herein.\n\n\nLeveraging ChatGPT for Enhancing Critical Thinking Skills\nYing Guo, Daniel Lee doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00505\nThis article presents a study conducted at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) to explore the use of ChatGPT, a large language model, for fostering critical thinking skills in higher education. The study implemented a ChatGPT-based activity in introductory chemistry courses, where students engaged with ChatGPT in three stages: account setup and orientation, essay creation, and output revision and validation. The results showed significant improvements in students’ confidence to ask insightful questions, analyze information, and comprehend complex concepts. Students reported that ChatGPT provided diverse perspectives and challenged their current ways of thinking. They also expressed an increased utilization of ChatGPT to enhance critical thinking skills and a willingness to recommend it to others. However, challenges included low-quality student comments and difficulties in validating information sources. The study highlights the importance of comprehensive training for educators and access to reliable resources. Future research should focus on training educators in integrating ChatGPT effectively and ensuring student awareness of privacy and security considerations. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights for leveraging AI technologies like ChatGPT to foster critical thinking skills in higher education.\n\n\nAn Analysis of AI-Generated Laboratory Reports across the Chemistry Curriculum and Student Perceptions of ChatGPT\nJoseph K. West, Jeanne L. Franz, Sara M. Hein, Hannah R. Leverentz-Culp, Jonathon F. Mauser, Emily F. Ruff, and Jennifer M. Zemke doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00581\nAI technologies are rapidly pervading many areas of our world. AI-driven text generators such as ChatGPT are at the forefront of this due to their simplicity and accessibility. Their influence on higher education is already being observed, and perceptions among faculty and students vary widely. We have undertaken a cross-curriculum study of ChatGPT’s ability to generate laboratory reports. AI-generated reports from general, organic, analytical, physical, inorganic, and biochemistry courses were graded as if they were student reports and analyzed for grade distributions and common strengths and weaknesses. To further gauge ChatGPT’s current impact, we surveyed all students in our Spring 2023 laboratory courses regarding their awareness and use of ChatGPT. We have also laid out suggestions, guidance, and considerations for instructors who wish to prohibit ChatGPT use by their students as well as for those who wish to begin incorporating this new, powerful tool into their teaching.\n\n\nUsing generative artificial intelligence in chemistry education research: prioritizing ethical use and accessibility\nDeng JM, Lalani Z, McDermaid LA, Szozda AR, https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-24zfl (unreviewed preprint)\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to drastically alter how we teach and conduct research in chemistry education. There have been many reports on the potential uses, limitations, and considerations for GenAI tools in teaching and learning, but there have been fewer discussions of how such tools could be leveraged in educational research, including in chemistry education research. GenAI tools can be used to facilitate and support researchers in every stage of traditional educational research projects (e.g. conducting literature reviews, designing research questions and methods, communicating results). However, these tools also have existing limitations that researchers must be aware of prior to and during use. In this research commentary, we share insights on how chemistry education researchers can use GenAI tools in their work ethically. We also share how GenAI tools can be leveraged to improve accessibility and equity in research.\n\n\nChatGPT Needs a Chemistry Tutor, Too\nAlfredo J. Leon and Dinesh Vidhani, Journal of Chemical Education, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00288\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technology has the potential to revolutionize the education sector. This study sought to determine the efficacy of ChatGPT to correctly answer questions a learner would use and to elucidate how the AI was processing potential prompts. Our goal was to evaluate the role of prompt formats, response consistency, and reliability of ChatGPT responses. Analyzing prompt format, we see that the data do not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between multiple-choice and free-response questions. Neither format achieved scores higher than 37%, and testing at different locations did not improve scores. Interestingly, ChatGPT’s free version provides accurate responses to discipline-specific questions that contain information from unrelated topics as distractors, improving its accuracy over the free-response questions. It is important to consider, while ChatGPT can identify the correct answer within a given context, it may not be able to determine if the answer it selects is correct computationally or through analysis. The results of this study can guide future AI and ChatGPT training practices and implementations to ensure they are used to their fullest potential.\n\n\nSciBench: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models\nXiaoxuan Wang, et al, arXiv Computer Science, https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10635\nAbstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable progress on many mathematical benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks only feature problems grounded in junior and senior high school subjects, contain only multiple-choice questions, and are confined to a limited scope of elementary arithmetic operations. To address these issues, this paper introduces an expansive benchmark suite SciBench that aims to systematically examine the reasoning capabilities required for complex scientific problem solving. SciBench contains two carefully curated datasets: an open set featuring a range of collegiate-level scientific problems drawn from mathematics, chemistry, and physics textbooks, and a closed set comprising problems from undergraduate-level exams in computer science and mathematics. Based on the two datasets, we conduct an in-depth benchmark study of two representative LLMs with various prompting strategies. The results reveal that current LLMs fall short of delivering satisfactory performance, with an overall score of merely 35.80%. Furthermore, through a detailed user study, we categorize the errors made by LLMs into ten problem-solving abilities. Our analysis indicates that no single prompting strategy significantly outperforms others and some strategies that demonstrate improvements in certain problem-solving skills result in declines in other skills. We envision that SciBench will catalyze further developments in the reasoning abilities of LLMs, thereby ultimately contributing to scientific research and discovery.\n\n\nChallenging ChatGPT with Chemistry-Related Subjects\nPimentel, et al https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-xl6w3 (unreviewed)\nAbstract: Tools based on large language models such as ChatGPT may revolutionize information retrieval and knowledge discovery, particularly with the vast amount of electronic material available. In this communication we evaluate how two versions of ChatGPT can answer complex questions on chemistry-related subjects in six topics. The tools are still insufficient to deal with subtleties of complex topics, especially as they do not have access to the whole of the scientific literature. However, the progress from ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-4 is an indicator that we shall soon have tools to assist scientists in surveys, reviews of the literature, and for teaching.\n\n\nDo Large Language Models Understand Chemistry? A Conversation with ChatGPT\nPimentel, et al,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 2023 63 (6), 1649-1655, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00285\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have promised a revolution in answering complex questions using the ChatGPT model. Its application in chemistry is still in its infancy. This viewpoint addresses the question of how well ChatGPT understands chemistry by posing five simple tasks in different subareas of chemistry.\n\n\nGenerative AI in Education and Research: Opportunities, Concerns, and Solutions\nAlasadi & Baiz, J. Chem. Educ. 2023, 100, 8, 2965–2971, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00323\nAbstract: In this article, we discuss the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education. The integration of AI in education has sparked a paradigm shift in teaching and learning, presenting both unparalleled opportunities and complex challenges. This paper explores critical aspects of implementing AI in education to advance educational goals, ethical considerations in scientific publications, and the attribution of credit for AI-driven discoveries. We also examine the implications of using AI-generated content in professional activities and describe equity and accessibility concerns. By weaving these key questions into a comprehensive discussion, this article aims to provide a balanced perspective on the responsible and effective use of these technologies in education, highlighting the need for a thoughtful, ethical, and inclusive approach to their integration.\n\n\nExploring the use of large language models (LLMs) in chemical engineering education: Building core course problem models with Chat-GPT\nMeng-Lin Tsai, et al, Education for Chemical Engineers, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ece.2023.05.001\nAbstract: This study highlights the potential benefits of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into chemical engineering education. In this study, Chat-GPT, a user-friendly LLM, is used as a problem-solving tool. Chemical engineering education has traditionally focused on fundamental knowledge in the classroom with limited opportunities for hands-on problem-solving. To address this issue, our study proposes an LLMs-assisted problem-solving procedure. This approach promotes critical thinking, enhances problem-solving abilities, and facilitates a deeper understanding of core subjects. Furthermore, incorporating programming into chemical engineering education prepares students with vital Industry 4.0 skills for contemporary industrial practices. During our experimental lecture, we introduced a simple example of building a model to calculate steam turbine cycle efficiency, and assigned projects to students for exploring the possible use of LLMs in solving various aspect of chemical engineering problems. Although it received mixed feedback from students, it was found to be an accessible and practical tool for improving problem-solving efficiency. Analyzing the student projects, we identified five common difficulties and misconceptions and provided helpful suggestions for overcoming them. Our course has limitations regarding using advanced tools and addressing complex problems. We further provide two additional examples to better demonstrate how to integrate LLMs into core courses. We emphasize the importance of universities, professors, and students actively embracing and utilizing LLMs as tools for chemical engineering education. Students must develop critical thinking skills and a thorough understanding of the principles behind LLMs, taking responsibility for their use and creations. This study provides valuable insights for enhancing chemical engineering education’s learning experience and outcomes by integrating LLMs.\n\n\nChatGPT in physics education: A pilot study on easy-to-implement activities\nBitzenbauer, Cont. Ed. Tech., 15, 3, https://doi.org/10.30935/cedtech/13176\nAbstract: Large language models, such as ChatGPT, have great potential to enhance learning and support teachers, but they must be used with care to tackle limitations and biases. This paper presents two easy-to-implement examples of how ChatGPT can be used in physics classrooms to foster critical thinking skills at the secondary school level. A pilot study (n=53) examining the implementation of these examples found that the intervention had a positive impact on students’ perceptions of ChatGPT, with an increase in agreement with statements related to its benefits and incorporation into their daily lives.\n\n\nAssessment of chemistry knowledge in large language models that generate code\nWhite, et al, Digital Discovery, 2023,2, 368-376, https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00087C, unreviewed preprint: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-3md3n-v2\nAbstract: In this work, we investigate the question: do code-generating large language models know chemistry? Our results indicate, mostly yes. To evaluate this, we introduce an expandable framework for evaluating chemistry knowledge in these models, through prompting models to solve chemistry problems posed as coding tasks. To do so, we produce a benchmark set of problems, and evaluate these models based on correctness of code by automated testing and evaluation by experts. We find that recent LLMs are able to write correct code across a variety of topics in chemistry and their accuracy can be increased by 30 percentage points via prompt engineering strategies, like putting copyright notices at the top of files. Our dataset and evaluation tools are open source which can be contributed to or built upon by future researchers, and will serve as a community resource for evaluating the performance of new models as they emerge. We also describe some good practices for employing LLMs in chemistry. The general success of these models demonstrates that their impact on chemistry teaching and research is poised to be enormous.\n\n\nNatural language processing models that automate programming will transform chemistry research and teaching\nHocky and White, Digital Discovery, 2022, 1, 79-83, https://doi.org/10.1039/D1DD00009H\nAbstract: Natural language processing models have emerged that can generate useable software and automate a number of programming tasks with high fidelity. These tools have yet to have an impact on the chemistry community. Yet, our initial testing demonstrates that this form of artificial intelligence is poised to transform chemistry and chemical engineering research. Here, we review developments that brought us to this point, examine applications in chemistry, and give our perspective on how this may fundamentally alter research and teaching.\n\n\nWhat is ChatGPT doing…and why does it work?\nStephen Wolfram Writings: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\nYouTube video: https://youtu.be/flXrLGPY3SU?t=575\nKEYWORDS: GPT, ChatGPT, LLM, teaching, chemistry \n\n\nFuture Trends Forum: Discussing the future of education and technology\nBryan Alexander, Future Trends Forum YouTube video series on AI\n\nHow can we teach creatively with AI?\nDepauw University professor Harry Brown describes and shows his class experiments.\nHow should academics react to AI?\nHow should higher education respond to new developments in artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT and image creating applications?\nHow might Higher Education respond to AI?\nComputer scientist and ed tech leader Ruben Puentedura explores the implications of large language model artificial intelligence.\nOpen Source AI for Higher Education\nHow can higher education grapple with artificial intelligence?

In this work we use a lattice model to show that the configurational entropy needs to be merged with the molecular translational entropy in order to have a consistent model. This is achieved by replacing the volume of a lattice site with a quantum volume (i.e., the cube of the thermal wavelength). This modified lattice model allows us to derive a new equation of state, referred to as the Bragg-Williams equation state, from which we may also derive a generalized version of the van der Waals equation of state. In contrast to the standard van der Waals equation of state, the heat capacity of the new models has temperature dependence.\n\nReference\nÅstrand P-O, de Miguel R., ChemRxiv. 2024; 10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3wlrd-v5\nThis content is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-ND 4.0"

    "text": "This paper reports a laboratory experiment that determines the kinetics of the reaction of coumarin-102, a fluorescent dye, with sodium hydroxide. The reaction is studied by monitoring the loss of coumarin-102 fluorescence during ring-opening saponification by hydroxide using smartphone cameras and near-UV (“blacklight”) illumination. The order of the reaction in coumarin-102 is determined by examining the time course of fluorescence decay over time and fitting the data to integrated rate law models. The order of the reaction in sodium hydroxide is determined by varying the concentration of NaOH and comparing the impact on the rate of the reaction. This represents an easy-to-implement kinetics experiment that uses an engaging phenomenon (fluorescence), a convenient data-acquisition technology (smartphone cameras), and an important image-processing software program (ImageJ). This gives students the ability to work with the determination of the rate law for both coumarin-102 and sodium hydroxide using complementary methods. This experiment is both informative and enjoyable for students, enabling them to directly observe kinetics─quite literally with open eyes─making scientific concepts more tangible and engaging. The experiment has also been adapted in a manner consistent with the principles of evidence-centered design using the content of kinetics and the scientific practice of mathematical reasoning.\n\nReference\nDonald.

The numerical simulations from the program are close to the analytical solutions and can effectively reflect the kinetic characteristics of different types of reactions. The effectiveness of the simulation program in promoting learning was verified by experimental and control groups, and the score rate of the experimental group (89.7%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (66.6%).

    "section": "",
    "text": "The process of diffusion is intimately related to random molecular displacement and is central to many problems in chemistry. Here, we provide an intuitive derivation of the diffusion equation based on the analysis of the random trajectories of particles generated and plotted by simple MATLAB and Python scripts. The codes are very simple and profusely commented on, so they can be modified by students and instructors with little experience with these software packages. The codes plot the trajectories in 1D, 2D, and 3D of a number of particles during a number of steps, both specified by the operator.

The Python programming language is used, taking advantage of the pedagogical benefits of Jupyter notebooks, primarily the ability to intersperse instructions and interactive code cells. A series of five notebooks, plus one traditional script exercise, are designed to teach basic techniques (e.g., loops, assignments, data types), instrument interfacing, model fitting, and introductory quantum chemistry. The skills are directly applicable to laboratories the students perform during the hands-on portion of the courses.

Students have experienced data collection and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and prediction. The No-Code-Low-Code Orange3 tool has been used for the process of modeling and prediction so that even beginners can easily perform Machine Learning (ML) analysis. The raw dataset containing 24 characteristics for 277,569 compounds went through data preprocessing process and became a well-refined dataset. The Random Forest model accurately predicted whether the type of compound in the unknown dataset was hydrocarbons, alcohols, or amines and predicted the boiling points of the some arbitrary compounds within the average error range of 4.49K.

Under red-light illumination, methylene blue forms a highly oxidizing excited state which is reduced by ascorbic acid, resulting in the colorless leucomethylene blue and the loss of methylene blue spectral features. Using a laser diode of steady output power, the quantum yield of the photoreaction was experimentally determined to be Φrxn = 0.106─indicating that about one in ten absorbed photons results in a productive reaction in this system. Φrxn is a critical metric in developing efficient photochemical reactions. The reaction was then used as a chemical actinometer to measure the power of an inexpensive red laser pointer and LED. These facile experiments can be employed in analytical and physical chemistry courses to expose students to important photochemical concepts through the familiar lens of UV–vis spectroscopy.\n\nReference\nTorrence L.

Students also must demonstrate mastery in some specs to earn high letter grades. There have been several reports in lower division college chemistry courses that use specs grading systems (e.g., general and organic chemistries), but there remains a dearth of accounts of specs grading systems in upper division courses. In this manuscript, we report on the use of specs grading systems at a primarily undergraduate women’s college in four upper division chemistry courses: biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. The conceptual framework for designing specs tailored to upper division chemistry courses and their use to assess student understanding of course content are shared along with student outcomes and feedback. The upper division students generally had a positive view of the specs grading system with students viewing themselves as working hard on assessments that were tough but fair. Finally, instructor comments are presented in an effort to highlight the perceived benefits and challenges of specs grading to future adopters.\n\nReference\nMichael J. Drummond, LeeAnn M.

In this paper, we present key findings from a study investigating chemistry students solving tasks centred around the steady-state approximation. Building upon the mathematical modelling cycle (MMC), qualitative analysis of the data collected using a think-aloud protocol led to the development of the extended MMC. This empirically derived extended MMC offers a more detailed account of the processes involved in mathematical modelling of chemical phenomena, highlighting aspects such as the occurrence of deliberation and evaluation throughout the modelling cycle, as well as the varying characteristics, points of activation and roles of extra-mathematical resources during problem solving. We further introduce and use problem- solving trajectories as a tool for visualising and analysing the complex and diverse approaches used by students in their attempts at reaching a solution. Overall, the extended MMC provides a finer-grained model of the cognitive and metacognitive activities that students engage in, offering further insights for research and practice.\n\nReference\nSofie Ye, Maja Elmgren, Magnus Jacobsson, and Felix M.

The DSC techniques employed determine accurate equilibrium freezing temperatures (Tf) of glycerol–water mixtures with glycerol mole fractions (xg) between 0 and 0.201. When xg ≥ 0.300, the slow rate of crystallization of glycerol inhibits crystallization, and solutions exhibit a Tg rather than a Tf. The Tf’s serve to discuss solid–liquid equilibria and estimate eutectic phase diagrams with varying levels of accuracy. The Tg’s serve to estimate the Tg of water (135.3 ± 1.2 K).

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is this experiment about?\n\nIn this experiment, students collect and interpret IR spectra of a diatomic molecule (typically HCl or CO) with varying resolution. Students develop an energy level diagram and relate it to the rotational-vibrational spectra. They use spectral data to evaluate and refine quantum models, which are then used to extract molecular parameters including rotational constant and bond length. The lab presumes that the students are familiar with the fundamental ideas of spectroscopy (i.e. the energy of the radiation matches the energy change in the molecule being studied) and have had prior exposure to IR spectroscopy (likely in an organic chemistry course).\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nAfter collecting gas phase IR spectra of a small molecule at several different resolutions, students then try an initial mathematical model to fit the data and then work through the process of refining that model. Students consider the effect of resolution on the uncertainties of extracted parameters. Four additional optional cycles focus on isotopes, overtones, and statistical mechanics. Students can complete the non-optional portions of the experiment in two lab sessions. What equipment and supplies will you need? Data sets (HCl and CO) are available if an instructor wants to do this as a dry lab. For instructors collecting data, an IR instrument and a gas sample will be needed. Data analysis templates are available as an Excel spreadsheet and a Jupyter notebook.\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nThe experiment is often students’ first exposure to obtaining and analyzing spectra with sub-wavenumber resolution. Students use mathematical models to generate ro-vibrational energy diagrams and then use experimental data to update their diagrams and mathematical models. Students also acquire data at different spectral resolutions, enforcing the connection between resolution and the precision of the reported molecular constants. This experiment expands students’ understanding of how IR spectroscopy can be used beyond their previous classes where IR is used mainly for functional group identification.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents sketch a predicted IR spectrum and then go on to predict the effect of resolution on the spectrum. Students work in groups to collect spectra at different resolutions and then pool their data as a class. In groups and as a class, students are prompted to work through the process of refining model equations used to fit the spectra, using residuals to evaluate the fit. Students can then use the model to determine molecular parameters like the rotational constant and bond length, learning what information can be extracted from an IR spectrum.\n\n\nReference\nJordan P.

Hydrogen-like basis functions for the 1s and 2s orbitals have been chosen, with associated effective charges treated as adjustable parameters. Instead of solving self-consistent equations, the total energy is minimized directly with respect to the orbital effective charges with the aid of the Solver add-in of Excel or by means of the virial theorem. The workbooks provide interactive input of the spin occupations of 1s and 2s orbitals, thus allowing calculation of the total energy not only of the ground-state neutral atoms but also of the first excited singlet and triplet states of helium and helium-like atoms, of the hydrogen anion H- (hydride), and of the lithium and beryllium cations. The calculated total energies are compatible with those obtained by elaborated general-purpose quantum chemistry programs. The workbooks are suitable for upper-division undergraduates or postgraduate students with no previous programming experience. They are open for upgrade and could be used for different forms of computer-based learning in the frame of classroom activities or coursework assignments.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Despite institutional reform efforts to increase use of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) in undergraduate chemistry and STEM courses, didactic lecture remains the predominant mode of instruction. Research to inform these initiatives routinely focuses on drivers and barriers to EBIP adoption, with recent work investigating factors associated with faculty members’ cooperative adoption of EBIPs from five STEM disciplines including chemistry. To understand the role of these specific factors within undergraduate chemistry education across a broad set of institutions, we conducted a national survey of chemistry faculty members (n = 1105) from the United States in Spring 2023. The survey targeted constructs that may underlie the cooperative adoption of EBIPs, including faculty members’ perception of (1) using EBIPs as mutually beneficial, (2) having their success and failure intertwined, and (3) institutional climate around teaching. The survey also included items targeting teaching-specific social interactions, another potential aspect of cooperative adoption. Results from multilevel modeling suggest that EBIP adoption is associated with chemistry faculty members’ perception of using EBIPs as mutually beneficial, aligning with prior findings on STEM faculty members’ cooperative adoption of these practices. However, there is no evidence of an association between EBIP adoption and chemistry faculty members’ perception of campus climate around teaching, where prior findings indicate an inverse association among STEM faculty members. Results further indicate that EBIP adoption is associated with the number of people with whom one specifically discusses pedagogy, instruction, and assessment. Collectively, our results demonstrate that differences exist between STEM disciplines and point toward the chemistry education research community’s responsibility to further explore EBIP adoption from a disciplinary lens. Our investigation also provides insight into factors associated with the cooperative adoption of EBIPs among chemistry faculty members on a national level; we identify several implications for how chemistry faculty member change agents (e.g., course coordinators, department leaders) may effectively promote EBIP adoption across the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.\n\nReference\nConnor, Megan C. and Raker, Jeffrey R., Chem.

    "section": "",
    "text": "UV–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry is a fundamental analytical technique widely used in chemistry, biology, materials science, and medical research. Despite its significance, undergraduate education often presents UV–vis spectroscopy narrowly as an absorbance-based method governed by the Beer–Lambert Law. This traditional framework, while effective for idealized solutions, fails to address the complexities of real-world samples that scatter or emit light, leading to widespread challenges in data interpretation. To bridge this gap, this work introduces an expanded pedagogical approach that incorporates the theoretical foundations of UV–vis spectroscopy for solutions exhibiting diverse optical behaviors. These include pure absorbers, pure scatterers, simultaneous absorbers and scatterers, simultaneous absorbers and emitters, and solutions that encompass absorption, scattering, and emission. We present accessible theoretical models designed to accommodate students with varying levels of mathematical proficiency, parametrizing UV–vis signals within the capabilities of standard spectrophotometers. Additionally, we outline instructional strategies to enhance comprehension across different educational levels, making these advanced concepts more approachable. This framework lays the groundwork for future studies that will feature laboratory modules leveraging commercially available UV–vis and fluorescence spectrophotometers to reinforce hands-on, evidence-based learning. By broadening the scope of UV–vis education and addressing critical gaps in traditional instruction, this work aims to deepen students’ conceptual and practical understanding of spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, it seeks to rectify common misinterpretations in the literature, equipping students with the analytical skills necessary for accurate, rigorous spectral interpretation. Ultimately, this effort aspires to transform UV–vis spectroscopy education by fostering both theoretical and practical mastery, preparing students for the challenges of modern scientific research and industry applications.\n\nReference\nPathum Wathudura, Huy Pham, Kumudu Siriwardana, Sumudu Athukorale, Udaya Jayasundara, Sameera R.

    "text": "What is this experiment about?\n\nStudents explore intermolecular forces through molecular dynamics simulations, providing access to quantities that are not typically experimentally measurable. Using simulations of pentane isomers in condensed phases, students identify the intramolecular and intermolecular energies present. They analyze enthalpies of vaporization based on the magnitudes of the intermolecular forces for each isomer. Doing so provides a quantitative approach to previously qualitative explanations and motivates the study of identifying the temperature of the vaporization phase transition. An introduction to thermochemistry is sufficient for students to do this experiment.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nStudents review intermolecular forces and make predictions about pentane isomer boiling points in the pre-experiment questions. In the first cycle, they run molecular dynamics simulations on pentane isomers in a condensed phase to examine the total and component energies. They calculate enthalpies of vaporization, comparing them to literature results, and use the set of class data to see how the results arise from differences in the component energies. In the second cycle, constant-pressure simulations and varying temperatures are used to examine vaporization dynamics. Through examination of the class results, students can propose further simulations that allow estimation of the neopentane vaporization temperature. Students can complete both cycles in two lab periods.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\nCalculations can be done on ChemCompute (https://chemcompute.org/) or a molecular dynamics package of the instructor’s choice. A supplement to the lab handout describes how to do the calculations and analyze the results using ChemCompute. Instructors may also wish to consider doing the calculations on ChemCompute and using a more fully-featured visualization program such as VMD.\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nThis experiment shows the utility of molecular dynamics simulations in probing molecular interactions that are not accessible through experiment. Instructors with limited experience using molecular dynamics will have the tools to facilitate the experiment effectively. Students will see how molecular dynamics allow quantitative analysis of microscopic forces that have previously only been addressed qualitatively.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents make predictions about the boiling points of pentane isomers and then show how those can be tested and explained with molecular dynamics simulations. They make experimental design choices such as deciding on simulations to run for estimating the boiling point of a pentane isomer. They use graphical representations to examine the nature of the simulation box and dynamics and mathematical models to in calculating an enthalpy of vaporization.

We propose that these definitions, including their theoretical, practical and even philosophical issues, should be taught to advanced undergraduate chemistry students as an essential introduction to the chemical bond module of quantum chemistry courses. This is a controversial topic due to the lack of consensus in the chemical bond community over this heavily disputed topic and the conflicting pedagogical approach; however, and maybe because of this controversy, the teaching of the definitions of the chemical bond including their open questions and challenges can be positively instructive.\n\nReference\nKozuch S.

The bootcamp is held immediately before the start of the first semester of graduate school and uses an active learning approach to review and practice undergraduate-level mathematics problems over five days in small student groups. This work includes the development and presentation of a new, publicly available mathematics curriculum for the bootcamp on select mathematics topics, including calculus, linear algebra, functions, differential equations, statistics and coding in Python, aiming at improving students’ confidence and learning experiences in graduate quantum mechanics and statistical physics courses. Surveys before and after the bootcamp showed an increase in students’ confidence in problem-solving in key mathematical areas and in social aspects of peer-led group learning. Qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates that the bootcamp reduced prior inequities in students’ confidence metrics based on gender and mathematical background.\n\nReference\nClune R, Das A, Jasrasaria D, Rossomme E, Cohen O, Baranger AM.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this laboratory activity, students were tasked with determining the heat of combustion for each of three common sugar substitutes: saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose. The heats of combustion were determined via three different methods: bomb calorimetry, heats of formation derived from semiempirical calculations, and tabulated average bond energies. Students were then tasked with writing a single laboratory report that combined and compared the results obtained from all three techniques. This gave them an experience more representative of writing a journal article than traditional laboratory reports that typically focused on outcomes from a single laboratory technique. The results from the two theoretical methods were compared via percent error and error analysis with the experimentally determined results. The comparison of the experimentally determined heats of combustion and the semiempirically derived heats of combustion all yielded errors of less than about 20%, while the comparisons of the experimentally determined heats of combustion and the bond-energy-derived heats of combustion yielded errors of 20—50%. In addition to the experience with writing the more complex laboratory report, students gained experience working with process hazards that involved elevated and changing gas pressure, performing computational calculations, and applying skills learned in previous chemistry courses. This laboratory activity is presented so that it will allow adoption by others, including student handouts for the bomb calorimetry and theoretical determination activities and notes for the instructor.\n\nReference\nAndrea D.

Typically, the most effective way to convey DFT concepts is through illustrative examples that are currently lacking in available resources. In this work, we demonstrate total energy calculations for H2 using 1s Slater type orbitals (STOs) within the framework of DFT. The molecular orbitals are constructed from a linear combination of 1s STOs centered on each atom. Using the Kohn–Sham equation, an equivalent expression for total energy, based on Kohn–Sham orbital eigenvalues, is given, aligning with that of the Hartree–Fock method. Detailed evaluations of Slater and X-Alpha exchange energies are presented along with a plotted potential energy surface and variations in density. Comparison with STO-nG basis sets not only supports the current work but also demonstrates the superiority of 1s STO over them. These features are included in the H2 Jupyter Notebook which is freely accessible at https://github.com/choirunnr/dft-h2-1s. Additionally, the H2 Jupyter Notebook was assessed for its implementation, receiving largely positive responses.

Deep learning is specifically about connecting some input data (features) and output data (labels) with a neural network function. In this book, we will view deep learning as a set of tools that allows us to create models that were previously infeasible with classical machine learning. What sets deep learning apart from classic machine learning is feature engineering. Much of the data-driven work in the past required decisions about what features are important and how to compute them from molecules. These are called descriptors. Deep learning is typically trained end-to-end, meaning decisions about which features are important are no longer relevant and we can work directly with molecular structures.

    "text": "A cornerstone activity in undergraduate organic laboratories revolves around students running instrumental analysis on their products and interpreting their spectra. They are left to link the theory they have learned in lecture to practical spectral interpretation. Students often memorize benchmark interpretations of peaks, such as the broad alcohol absorbance in infrared spectroscopy (IR). However, students often do not correlate the absorbance frequency to the actual vibrational mode. Given more nuanced spectra to interpret, like the difference between a hydrogen and a deuterium on an alcohol, students often miss the differences between the spectra. The GAMESS computational software package accessed through the Web interface ChemCompute is successfully used by students here to generate IR spectra of different isotopically labeled alcohols. This Web-based portal provides multiple benefits to the students: (1) The computational software is accessible through any browser on most common operating systems (including Chromebooks), (2) generating IR spectra for multiple products allows students to predict differences in spectra to compare to their actual IR data reinforcing prediction in the scientific method, and (3) the software links the differences in isotopes to structural vibrational modes visualized in the software allowing students to link theory to practice in spectral interpretation.\nKEYWORDS: Second-Year Undergraduate, Upper-Division Undergraduate, Organic Chemistry, Inquiry-Based, Discovery Learning, Computational Chemistry, IR Spectroscopy, Isotopes\nThe learning outcomes for students are the following:\n\nConnect the vibrational modes of a molecule to the vibrational frequencies observed in experimentally derived spectra.\nUse the computational derived spectra to predict experimentally derived spectra.\nArticulate how IR spectroscopy can be used to determine the position of deuterium in a labeled compound by observation of the change in vibrational frequencies\n\n\nReference\nMichael W.

We provided students with digest video materials for flipped learning, a cloud computing environment, and video conferencing tools. These materials enhanced the course contents to facilitate effective education during the pandemic. The results of a questionnaire survey showed that students were delighted with the new course, which comprehensively included experiments, computation, and data science.\nThe new course content has been restructured to conform to well-known textbooks. It includes the concepts of phase equilibria, buffers, titration, intermolecular interactions, spectroscopy, solutions, coordination chemistry, and kinetics. These contents correspond to our textbook chapters “Condensed Systems Study by Chemical Thermodynamics and Data Science”, and “Single Molecules Study by Spectroscopy and Quantum Chemistry”.

The syllabus is often the first interaction students have with a course, and its content can set the tone for their learning experience. Our previous analysis of the learning-centeredness of 92 physical chemistry syllabi revealed that the document is largely content-focused. However, the transition to remote instruction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in instructional strategies, institutional policies, and practices, and, we hypothesized, syllabi focus. We collected physical chemistry syllabi from 25 of the same institutions and instructors between spring 2021 and spring 2022 and qualitatively analyzed the extent of change in the focus of the documents using the same rubric that we used for our initial analysis. We documented an overall increase in learning focus in the 2021–2022 syllabi. While there were no significant changes to learning goals and objectives, there was evidence of positive change in assessment activities and communication of learning-focused environments. This communication gives a snapshot of changes in physical chemistry syllabi after the transition to remote teaching. Our results reiterate implications from our previous analysis and highlight changes to the landscape of physical chemistry syllabi.\n\nReference\nJulie Donnelly, Kurt Winkelmann, Yara Khallaf, J.

Students work with computational chemistry to evaluate approaches that will provide reasonable results in a reasonable time for the thermochemistry of fluoropropane decomposition. They explore the tradeoff of computational accuracy against the cost of performing the calculations. Students also use the information available from the calculations to obtain thermochemical quantities and evaluate the different fluoropropanes.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nPre-experiment work focuses on the structure of fluoropropanes and the thermodynamics of the decomposition into an ethene and HF. In the first cycle, students perform computations on small molecules and analyze the output for electronic energy, vibrational frequency, and heat capacity. That motivates the second cycle where teams examine multiple basis set/method combinations, compare to existing computational and experimental data, and develop a rationale for using a particular basis set/method combination for fluoropropane calculations. The final cycle has students do those calculations for all the fluoropropanes and decomposition products, with a focus on reaction energies and heat capacities. They use that information to draw conclusions about balancing the fire suppression ability of a fluoropropane against its propensity to decompose into HF.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\nCalculations can be done on ChemCompute or a package of the instructor’s choice. A spreadsheet template is available that allows student teams to enter their results in a way that permits straightforward comparisons among the molecules.\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nComputational chemistry has found its way into many experimental research articles as well as being a focus of research on its own. This experiment has students investigate considerations for making good choices about how to perform those calculations in ways that can support experimental decisions and analysis. The experiment further makes direct connections to an important application–fire suppression systems that use fluoropopanes–demonstrating the significance of physical chemistry approaches.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents make predictions at several points in the experiment, in particular identifying which fluoropropane might be a good choice for a fire suppressant. They support their predictions with hypotheses developed from the application of computational models. Student teams interact to select a basis set/method combination for all calculations and share data about the numerous fluoropopanes that can be studied. They develop a variety of visual and graphical representations, such as Hess’s Law diagrams, to process the information from the calculations. Through making a case for their chosen fluoropropane, students demonstrate understanding of the complex concepts undergirding electronic structure calculations.\n\n\nReference\nReeves, M.

This activity highlights the large differences in energies between the isomeric enol and carbonyl forms of simple aldehydes, ketones, esters, and amides. The computed energy values are used to calculate equilibrium constants for keto–enol tautomerization to further underscore the thermodynamic preference for the carbonyl forms.

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is this experiment about?\n\nStudents are familiar with the browning of fruit, but they have typically not explored the chemistry behind the process. This experiment has students explore the kinetics of the oxidation of catechol catalyzed by the enzyme catecholase present to different degrees in different varieties of apples. Students engage in experimental design allowing for parameter variation (type of apple, pH) working with this natural system with many possible outcomes. Instructors can optionally have students explore enzyme inhibition\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nPre-experiment work has students consider experiment design, from making solutions to extracting juice from apples to making predictions about absorbance changes for the catechol solution. In the first cycle, students explore the browning reaction with and without enzyme, and in buffered and unbuffered solutions, comparing their predictions with experimental results. They then design an experiment (with the class) that allows application of Michaelis-Menten kinetics and development of a quantitative answer to the title question. These cycles can be performed in two lab periods of three or four hour length. Instructors can use additional time to have students complete an optional third cycle in which they develop an enzyme inhibition experiment.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\n\nVisible spectrophotometer; pH meter (or pH paper)\nEquipment for pureeing and extracting juice from apples (blender, paring knife, vacuum filtration)\nApples! catechol; Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 for making phosphate buffer solutions; inhibitors\n\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nThe study of enzyme kinetics links physical chemistry and biochemistry. Physical chemistry is represented in both the experimental design, particularly the investigation of multiple factors that can affect the kinetic behavior, and in the complexity and precision of the data analysis with an emphasis on comparing equation linearization to non-linear fitting. The investigation of enzyme inhibition provides a physical chemistry foundation to a significant biochemical concept.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents begin their work with both experiment design in considering how to obtain the data and making predictions about how the catechol oxidation reaction will be reflected in the absorbance data. Students share data to see the range of apple browning behavior and interact with other teams to do further work in experimental design. Students process information in multiple ways in this experiment: working with initial rates to see the range of kinetic behavior, then developing more substantial mathematical models and graphical representations to observe the underlying regularity and draw conclusions. The work on inhibition is helpful for students to demonstrate their understanding of the enzyme kinetics concepts.\n\n\nReference\nCole, R. S.; Muniz, M.; Harvey, E.; Sweeney, R.; Hunnicutt, S.

    "text": "Molecules and materials often display distributed heterogeneous properties. Modeling the behavior of a single molecule with these properties (e.g. via Monte-Carlo simulations) requires a rapid way to sample distributions of interest and describe how they evolve. Here, we pedagogically introduce a simple algorithm that converts evenly distributed random number generator outputs to any defined probability density function (PDF) called the Random Number Converter (RNC). We demonstrate a numerical approach to obtain cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and utilize a binary search algorithm to circumvent the need for analytical inverse CDFs. This simple method is demonstrated for various distributions, including single-exponential and Gaussian distributions and non-standard PDFs, for which neither the CDF nor its inverse are analytically solvable. We then apply this algorithm to the rate analysis of catalytic turnover cycles and Fourier spectroscopy, enabling the study of complex reaction kinetics and retrospective interferometry analysis. Our algorithm and examples can be used to train undergraduates on the tools that underlay Monte Carlo methods and connect physical chemistry to standard computer science and statistics. We provide a MATLAB and Python module in the Supporting Information with customizable parameters.\n\nReference\nLi B (Yangtao), Duong T, Neuhauser D, Alexandrova AN, Caram JR., ChemRxiv. 2024; doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4thlz This content is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-ND 4.0"

This systematic review builds on previous reviews in chemistry education research that focused on the other highly quantitative, calculation-heavy topics covered in upper-level physical chemistry courses (kinetics and thermodynamics). We aim to provide a resource for both practitioners and education researchers. Based on the topics of the research conducted in our sample (N=50), we grouped the articles into six categories: (1) students’ general challenges with quantum mechanics; (2) students’ conceptions of the atom; (3) students’ conceptions of bonding; (4) students’ conceptions of the quantum nature of light; (5) students’ conceptions of commonly used quantum mechanical models; (6) curricular materials and instruction. Relevant trends stemming from this work include that much of the research leans on education research in mathematics and physics to support the claim that students have difficulties with mathematics; however, these claims require further investigation within chemistry education contexts. Moreover, a suprising amount of research on quantum mechanics involved students sampled outside of upper-level chemistry courses (i.e., secondary-level and general chemistry contexts).\n\nReference\nS.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Fourier Transform (FT) is a fundamental tool that permeates modern science and technology. While chemistry undergraduates encounter the FT as early as the second year, their courses often only mention it in passing because computers frequently perform it automatically behind the scenes. Although this automation enables students to focus on ‘the chemistry’, students miss out on an opportunity to understand and use one of the most powerful tools in the scientific arsenal capable of revealing how time-dependent signals encode chemical structure. Although many educational resources introduce chemists to the FT, they often require familiarity with sophisticated mathematical and computational concepts. Here, we present a series of three self-contained, Python-based laboratory activities designed for undergraduates to understand the FT and apply it to analyze audio signals, an infrared (IR) spectroscopy interferogram, and a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) free induction decay (FID). In these activities, students observe how the FT reveals and quantifies the contribution of each frequency present in a temporal signal and how decay time scales dictate signal broadening. Our activities empower students with the tools to transform their own temporal data sets (e.g., FID) to a frequency spectrum. To ensure accessibility of the activities and lower the barrier to implementation, we utilize Google Colab’s open-source, cloud-based platform to run Jupyter notebooks. We also offer a prelaboratory activity that introduces students to the basics of Python and the Colab platform and reviews the math and programming skills needed to complete the lab activities. These lab activities help students build a qualitative, quantitative, and practical understanding of the FT.\n\nReference\nAnthony J. Dominic III, Nicholas L. Cipolla, William C.

Student assessment using traditional (exams) and novel (projects) approaches are highlighted, especially the use of projects that examined students’ ability to apply their knowledge to solve real world problems. A survey of students’ responses to online learning revealed that they felt supported during the COVID-19 crisis and the teaching tools described in this work were successful in helping them learn. These students who completed parts of the two courses in face-to-face classes in previous quarters overwhelmingly preferred in-person instruction. The pedagogical approaches described in the communication were shared informally with fellow science faculty at the college. They may be successful in teaching other chemistry courses and STEM fields. The author feels better prepared for teaching online in the future as a result of this teaching experience."

The activities have been tested both in settings that teach quantum first and also those that teach thermodynamics first, and we have found they serve students well in both contexts. Although it is assumed students are familiar with quantized energy levels, the activities do not require prior knowledge of Quantum Mechanics beyond a one-year general chemistry course.\nThe title of each activity includes both a label classifying the content and a number signaling the order. Activities labeled Fundamental, represent the core set of Thermodynamic topics suitable for an undergraduate physical chemistry course. They should be used in the order presented and generally without omission since each subsequent activity was written presuming either implicitly or explicitly the prior content as pre-requisite. Activities labeled StatMech and Kinetics cover content traditionally associated with these subject areas. In general, these activities could be introduced at anytime throughout the course depending on the instructor preference.\nActivities labeled “Extension” are intended to guide students more deeply into a particular topic and are numbered according to the prerequisite activity. Any extension activity can be used or omitted depending on the learning objectives identified for students. We presume that instructors will vary in terms of the details they wish to include on any topic depending on the context of the course they teach and their own interests. We have attempted to provide the necessary flexibility in these materials to allow instructors to present a particular category or extend fundamental concepts as they see fit in the course.\nLists of the content and process objectives describe what each student should achieve after completing the activity. Instructors may want to share this information with students or create assessment and evaluation materials that reinforce these stated objectives.The Instructor’s Guide also indicates the appropriate Extension activities for each Fundamentalactivity. Implementation Notes provide additional ideas or cautions regarding the use of theactivities in the classroom"

    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic illuminated challenges with assessment, especially in online environments that threaten academic integrity. In the wake of the pandemic, faculty in higher education were seeking alternative assessments that meet the assessment goal(s) of their classroom. Even though the COVID-based disruptions are diminishing, higher education continues to experience ongoing upheaval related to new technology, such as ChatGPT, requiring ongoing reevaluation of our assessment practices. Upon reflecting on our assessment goals, we explored oral exams as a potentially valuable tool in the assessment toolbox in Physical Chemistry I and II courses at two institutions. In analyzing the course evaluation data at both institutions, we found consistent themes in student-perceived challenges, student-perceived value, and instructor-perceived value. Students had an overwhelmingly positive response to the oral exam experience and recommended their continued use in spite of their perceived challenges. Students found the oral exams challenging due to the stress and anxiety of verbal presentation and the depth of understanding required to answer questions verbally. In response to these challenges, students adjusted their study habits to incorporate studying in groups, verbally speaking out loud, utilizing spaced practice methods, and focusing on understanding concepts and equations instead of relying on memorization of material. Considering the challenges and required adjustment in study habits, students still overwhelmingly recommend using oral exams because they recognize the value of communication and teamwork in their future careers. In addition to student value, the instructors found value in oral assessments, despite the challenges with time commitments, validity, reliability, and fairness. We believe oral assessments in undergraduate chemistry curricula warrant further investigation as a useful tool in the assessment toolbox."

It is not just for educators teaching courses in engineering or science, but also data journalism, business and quantitative economics, data-based decision sciences and policy, quantitative health sciences, and digital humanities. It aims to provide an entry point, and a broad overview of Jupyter in education. Whether you are already using Jupyter to teach, you have found learning materials built on Jupyter that piqued your curiosity, or have never heard of Jupyter, the material in this open book can empower you to use this technology in your teaching.\nThrough a series of anecdotes we will illustrate how you, as an educator, can use Jupyter notebooks to increase your students’ 1) engagement, 2) participation, 3) understanding, 4) performance, and 5) preparation for their career. These are starting places and we are confident that you will also take these examples in new and exciting directions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A nationwide survey of the undergraduate physical chemistry course was conducted to investigate the depth and breadth of content that is covered, how content is delivered, how student understanding is assessed, and the experiences and beliefs of instructors. The survey was administered to instructors of physical chemistry (N = 331) at American Chemical Society certified colleges and universities in the United States. The majority of instructors (N = 187) provided contact information, allowing responses to be associated with their institution. The goal of this preliminary study is to provide an awareness of the current state of physical chemistry courses across the United States. Several relationships regarding the course curriculum were investigated such as depth versus breadth of course content, and goal for understanding versus types of assessment questions. Also, several relationships regarding instructor beliefs and experiences were investigated such as degree of teacher preparation experience versus course delivery, and instructor beliefs about the challenging nature of physical chemistry education versus proposed strategies to overcome those challenges. Information gained from this study may inform the development of new teaching practices, curriculum, assessments, and resources for physical chemistry education, as well as encourage instructors of physical chemistry and researches of chemical education to work together to improve student understanding of physical chemistry."

    "text": "A simple Excel spreadsheet-based program for simulating atomic emission spectra from the properties of neutral atoms (e.g., energies and statistical weights of the electronic states, electronic partition functions, transition probabilities, etc.) is described. The contents of the spreadsheet (i.e., input parameters, formulas for calculating emission intensities, etc.) are in full view and are controllable by the student and instructor, and the result of changing temperature and line width on relative intensities can be observed in real time. Thorough descriptions of how to use the spreadsheet-based program, how to extract relevant quantum mechanical properties from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database, and how to create a new worksheet for an element of interest are also included. It is envisioned that the program will serve as a means for instructors to link atomic emission in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, as in the flame test demonstration, to the theoretical concepts of statistical and quantum mechanics encountered in advanced physical and analytical chemistry courses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "An experiment for the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory is described in which the Raman spectrum of liquid para-difluorobenzene is recorded and assigned. A density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the 30 normal modes of the molecule is undertaken using computational chemistry software. Students use group theory to determine which of the modes are Raman active. Guided by these results, they are able to identify 13 of the 15 symmetry-allowed fundamental bands in their Raman spectrum. The remaining 17 observed bands are assigned as either overtone or combination bands, by estimating the wavenumbers of symmetry-allowed transitions from the scaled results of their DFT calculation. The experiment demonstrates the powerful way in which group theory and computational chemistry can be used to assign a dense Raman spectrum of an organic compound.\nThe acquisition and measurement of the Raman lines of pDFB takes about 45 min, whereas the data analysis requires 3–4 h, depending on how fast a team works. Students begin their vibrational analysis by identifying the symmetries of the vibrational normal modes. They then complete a density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the Raman spectrum using the hybrid functional B3LYP with a 6-311G* basis set. With Spartan 20 software on a laptop computer, this calculation typically takes less than 10 min."

By weighting rotational energy degeneracies with a Boltzmann factor, they simulate the R-branch of the band; the result is a rudimentary estimate of the average temperature of the troposphere above the South Pole. A second activity simulates radiative emission in a saturated part of the spectrum as a Planck Blackbody, which yields the temperature of the atmosphere just above the surface. All computations and graphical displays are done in Jupyter Notebooks."

Critical thinking and active inquiry is promoted by open-ended responses to prompts (Pause for Analysis questions). Specific learning goals are as follows:\n\nLearn about the greenhouse effect.\nLearn how to download and plot a downwelling radiance spectrum from polar regions.\nUnderstand how gases contribute to the greenhouse effect, which are the most important, and how these contributions are unique in Polar Regions.\nExamine infrared spectral features due to rovibrational transitions.\nLearn how to model the populations of rotational states according to degeneracy and temperature.\nLearn how to use that population to infer an effective temperature of atmospheric CO2 in a downwelling emission spectrum from South Pole Station, Antarctica.\nLearn how blackbody radiation is related to downwelling radiation from the atmosphere.\nLearn how to use the Planck function and a downwelling radiance spectrum to estimate the surface temperature."

The activity has successfully been taught in over several class sections or in a longer lab section, for classes of 11 students or less, and is appropriate for up to 30 students. The activity typically takes 3 to 5 hours and includes homework assignments. No previous computational or coding experience is required. The instructor will give an introductory lecture on the quantum-mechanical concepts, assign pre-module homework, guide the students in working through the module, and facilitate group discussions. The module is adaptable – either of three parts can be used or modified, as has been done for a lower-level Engineering Physics course."

    "text": "In the 21st Century, research is increasingly data- and computation-driven. Researchers, funders, and the larger community today emphasize the traits of openness and reproducibility. In March 2017, 13 mostly early-career research leaders who are building their careers around these traits came together with ten university leaders (presidents, vice presidents, and vice provosts), representatives from four funding agencies, and eleven organizers and other stakeholders in an NIH- and NSF-funded one-day, invitation-only workshop titled “Imagining Tomorrow’s University.” Workshop attendees were charged with launching a new dialog around open research – the current status, opportunities for advancement, and challenges that limit sharing.\nThe workshop examined how the internet-enabled research world has changed, and how universities need to change to adapt commensurately, aiming to understand how universities can and should make themselves competitive and attract the best students, staff, and faculty in this new world. During the workshop, the participants re-imagined scholarship, education, and institutions for an open, networked era, to uncover new opportunities for universities to create value and serve society. They expressed the results of these deliberations as a set of 22 principles of tomorrow’s university across six areas: credit and attribution, communities, outreach and engagement, education, preservation and reproducibility, and technologies.\nActivities that follow on from workshop results take one of three forms. First, since the workshop, a number of workshop authors have further developed and published their white papers to make their reflections and recommendations more concrete. These authors are also conducting efforts to implement these ideas, and to make changes in the university system. Second, we plan to organise a follow-up workshop that focuses on how these principles could be implemented. Third, we believe that the outcomes of this workshop support and are connected with recent theoretical work on the position and future of open knowledge institutions."

Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the apparent nucleation of crystalline material. In this paper a simple experiment is described that demonstrates that nucleation is triggered by preserving seed crystals clamped between opposing metal surfaces. An explanation for the retention of the crystalline particles is the elevated melting point caused by very high local pressures. A series of thermophysical properties of the sodium acetate solution is also measured, including the available enthalpy upon crystallization of the supercooled substance, and liquid and solid phase specific heat capacities."

We have developed an open-access, interactive, electronic notebook that leverages a user-friendly interface to engage a new generation of visual learners with QD. We begin each topic (e.g., adiabaticity, light–matter interactions, and relaxation processes) with essential questions, issues, and background that orient the learner; we then move directly to visual explorations of the phenomena, where the learner can immediately manipulate parameters that control and drive the physics. This notebook requires only a computer that can run Wolfram’s computable document format (CDF) files (both the notebook and CDF player are free) and enables learning in a variety of contexts and grade levels: flipped classrooms, small groups, and high school students through advanced researchers. Without sacrificing rigor, Quantum Dynamics…with the Dynamics! (QDWD) aims to develop physical intuition and is built in the spirit of hands-on experimentation with immediate and visual results. The hierarchical structure of QDWD lends itself to differentiated instruction, where a motivated or advanced student can explore the computer code, mathematical formalism, and underpinning physics."

    "text": "Abstract: Techniques from the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning (ML) have been applied to a wide range of problems in chemistry. Nonetheless, there are very few examples of pedagogical activities to introduce ML to chemistry students in the chemistry education literature. Here we report a computational activity that introduces undergraduate physical chemistry students to ML in the context of vibrational spectroscopy. In the first part of the activity, students use ML binary classification algorithms to distinguish between carbonyl-containing and non-carbonyl-containing molecules on the basis of their infrared absorption spectra. In the second part of the activity, students test modifications to this basic analysis, including different analysis parameters, different ML algorithms, and different test datasets. In a final extension of the activity, students implement a multiclass classification to predict whether carbonyl-containing molecules contain a ketone, a carboxylic acid, or another carbonyl group. This activity is designed to introduce students both to the basic workflow of a ML classification analysis and to some of the ways in which machine learning analyses can fail. We provide a comprehensive handout for the activity, including theoretical background and a detailed protocol, as well as datasets and code to implement the exercise in Python or Mathematica. This activity is designed as a standalone exercise for physical chemistry lab classes but can also be integrated with courses or modules on vibrational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. On the basis of student surveys, we conclude that this activity was successful in introducing students to applications of ML in chemistry."

The first activity, aimed at undergraduate physical chemistry lab courses, involves students writing Python code in a Jupyter Notebook that is used to run LJ simulations and fit a Van der Waals gas model to data produced by the LJ fluid simulations. The second is a jigsaw activity, aimed at advanced undergraduate or graduate students, where students are assigned different sections of the LJ fluid simulation code, and must demonstrate the functionality of their section to the class by both giving an oral presentation and sharing a Jupyter Notebook demonstration of their own design.\nThis lab activity is intended to be used as part of an undergraduate physical chemistry lab course, but really the only prerequisite is that the student knows how to take the derivative of a polynomial. The activity does require students to write some Python code, but the video link above explains things so that the activity be completed by students who have not written code."

    "text": "A physical chemistry lab for undergraduate students described in this report is about applying kinetic models to analyze the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and obtain the reproduction numbers. The susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model and the SIR-vaccinated (SIRV) model are explained to the students and are used to analyze the COVID-19 spread data from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The basic reproduction number R0 and the real-time reproduction number Rt of COVID-19 are extracted by fitting the data with the models, which explains the spreading kinetics and provides a prediction of the spreading trend in a given state. The procedure outlined here shows the differences between the SIR model and the SIRV model. The SIRV model considers the effect of vaccination which helps explain the later stages of the ongoing pandemic. The predictive power of the models is also shown giving the students some certainty in the predictions they made for the following months.\nThis laboratory procedure can be completed in two weeks (4 three-hour labs). The students are instructed to collect literature research, process data, write reports, and receive additional instruction outside of class time if needed.\nExtending the kinetic model from SIR to SIRV helps the students to understand the later stages of disease prevention and experience kinetic model selection. Comparing the Rt and Re values help the students to distinguish the second-order reaction and the quasi-first order reaction models for the same reaction mechanism, which echoes what they have learned in the class well."

    "text": "Various studies have reported the versatility and great scope of programming tools in all areas of knowledge. Coding is generally of paramount importance to chemistry students regardless of whether they intend to work with theoretical chemistry. Google Colab notebooks can introduce students to programming concepts and could be a convenient tool to assist in the chemistry teaching process. In this article, we implemented Google Colab notebooks to aid in the teaching of thermodynamics in a physical chemistry class. We presented six notebooks, covering introductory concepts of both coding and thermodynamics as a set of learning objects that can be useful in a virtual learning environment. In addition, in some of the notebooks, we included a step-by-step guide on how to run virtual lab simulations. The Colab notebooks were created for students without previous experience in programming. All of the Colab notebooks contain exercises of the activities and the solutions of the proposed exercises. Furthermore, all of the Colab notebooks can be modified and downloaded from the Github repository. Finally, we used the Python programming language and Colab because they are free and widely used by the academic community.\nSessions in English and Spanish:"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Long in the making, computational chemistry for the masses is finally here. Our brief review on free and open source software (FOSS) packages points out the existence of software offering a wide range of functionality, all the way from approximate semiempirical calculations with tight-binding density functional theory to sophisticated ab initio wave function methods such as coupled-cluster theory, covering both molecular and solid-state systems. Combined with the remarkable increase in the computing power of personal devices, which now rivals that of the fastest supercomputers in the world in the 1990s, we demonstrate that a decentralized model for teaching computational chemistry is now possible thanks to FOSS packages, enabling students to perform reasonable modeling on their own computing devices in the bring your own device (BYOD) scheme. FOSS software can be made trivially simple to install and keep up to date, eliminating the need for departmental support, and also enables comprehensive teaching strategies, as various algorithms’ actual implementations can be used in teaching. We exemplify what kinds of calculations are feasible with four FOSS electronic structure programs, assuming only extremely modest computational resources, to illustrate how FOSS packages enable decentralized approaches to computational chemistry education within the BYOD scheme. FOSS also has further benefits driving its adoption: the open access to the source code of FOSS packages democratizes the science of computational chemistry, and FOSS packages can be used without limitation also beyond education, in academic and industrial applications, for example.\nThe repository contains the practical examples of combining the Bring Your Own Device approach with Free and Open Source Software to run quantum chemical calculations (BYOD-FOSS). The examples can be found inside the folders xtb, NWChem, Psi4, and QE."

This upper-division laboratory experiment teaches the basics of QD synthesis and pulsed field gradient NMR, a powerful technique for measuring diffusion coefficients in solution. The diffusion coefficients are used to calculate hydrodynamic radii, which are compared to core radii obtained from optical absorbance sizing curves, providing insight into the structure of QDs in colloidal suspension and the nature of the information provided by pulsed field gradient NMR.\nRequired Time: The QD synthesis and workup can be accomplished in a single 4 hour laboratory period. With judicious planning, the entire experiment can be run in two 4 hour laboratory periods. Alternatively, this experiment could be offered as an open-ended, multiperiod project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Density functional theory (DFT) has rapidly became the method of choice for the calculation of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules in both the teaching and the research environments. Despite a long history of successes in both fields, DFT still retains several limitations due to the fact that it relies on approximations. Advances on the research side have recently contributed to understand and reduce several of these limitations. The most important results have been obtained in the last two decades by using large databases of accurate data. These databases provided a better understanding of the limitations of current approximations and facilitated the development of more accurate ones. The educational literature, on the other side, has unfortunately remained behind. It is still common, in fact, to find computational laboratory courses that use outdated approximations, without providing a clear report of their limitations, and also failing to mention the modern alternatives. This article introduces a laboratory notebook for a computational chemistry course based on recent advances in DFT research. New approximations and neglected techniques are presented and discussed using data from modern research databases. The course is aimed at upper undergraduate and graduate students, but it includes enough research examples to be interesting for occasional practitioners and beginner researchers as well."

    "text": "The Morse potential is widely used in chemistry to describe interatomic interactions. However, there is no explicit derivation for this empirical potential from physically meaningful atomic quantities. We show that the Morse potential can be derived from a simple atomic screened charge model, which accounts for the shielded nuclear charge by the electron density and exponentially de- cays with distance. The bond dissociation energy of a diatomic molecule is obtained by combining the quantum mechanical covalent and classical electrostatic interactions. The revealed connections between the parameters of the Morse potential, the Pauling bond order and electronegativity bridge the gap between the classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of chemical bonds. The proposed derivation and interpretation of the Morse potential in terms of atomic quantities such as electron-nuclear attraction energy and orbital exponents will be valuable in helping students to form a simple picture of chemical bond."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn the midst of a global pandemic in spring 2020, physical chemistry faculty gathered to share strategies and resources for teaching remotely. During this conversation, instructors created a shared document compiling the challenges they faced in spring 2020 and ways to improve teaching and learning in the physical chemistry classroom and laboratory when institutions reopened in the fall. We present a content analysis of the shared document that provides a snapshot of physical chemists’ thoughts at that moment in June 2020. The themes that emerged from our analysis are assessment, choice of learning objectives, course management, opportunities, resources, student motivation, and wellbeing. We have summarized the numerous strategies, resources, and implementation ideas that were shared by participants, many of which we believe will remain in use when traditional in-person instruction resumes. Finally, the conversation connected physical chemists, strengthening our community. Continued community engagement has occurred through further synchronous conversations, asynchronous conversations on our Slack workspace, and the creation of the repository PChem Inspired Pedagogical Electronic Resource (PIPER)."

    "text": "The Hofmeister series is a recurring trend that ranks ions’ abilities to influence various aqueous processes in solution. Herein, a set of project-based experiments was developed for students in an upper-level physical chemistry laboratory to investigate the specific ion effects on the thermodynamics of caffeine partitioning between aqueous and cyclohexane phases. Students obtained the standard Gibbs free energy for caffeine partitioning in the presence of eight sodium salts in the aqueous phase at varied temperatures. The standard enthalpy and entropy for caffeine partitioning were obtained by plotting the standard Gibbs free energy vs temperature for each salt. Students then identified the trends in the thermodynamics for caffeine partitioning and explored the correlation between anions’ properties and their influence on caffeine partitioning thermodynamic parameters. This project-based laboratory allowed students to gain a deep understanding of ion properties in solution and learn how the Hofmeister ions affect various aqueous processes. It also helped students internalize some fundamental concepts in thermodynamics such as standard Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy.\nSupporting Information includes students’ raw data, correlation plots for strongly hydrated anions, and notes for instructors."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: Students’ negative perceptions of physical chemistry courses are well-known and are likely impacting their learning and performance in this upper-division course for majors. The syllabus can be the first interaction students have with a course and instructor and can be central to the expectations student set for the learning experience. While syllabi are not necessarily evidence of enacted classroom practice, their focus may be related to the enacted course design and instructional practices. Additionally, developing and modifying the document gives an instructor an opportunity to reflect on those same enacted practices, potentially facilitating a more learning-centered experience for students. In this study, we collected physical chemistry syllabi from across the United States and evaluated the learning-centeredness of this document using the Measuring the Promise syllabus rubric. Physical chemistry syllabi from 2017 to 2019 were largely content-focused. Analysis of the specific components of syllabi revealed potential improvements that may shift the focus of physical chemistry syllabi toward the learning end of the learning-centeredness spectrum. These include communicating learning goals and objectives across a wide range of dimensions, introducing transparency about the alignment of assessments with objectives, and creating supportive classroom climates via the syllabus."

    "text": "While computational chemistry methods are usually a research topic of their own, even in the undergraduate curriculum, many methods are becoming mainstream and can be used to appropriately compute chemical parameters that are not easily measured in the undergraduate laboratory. These calculations can be used to help students explore and understand chemical principles and properties. Visualization and animation of structures and properties are also aids in students’ exploration of chemistry. The ubiquity of personal computing devices capable of running calculations and the user-friendliness of software to fully optimize small and medium molecules using graphical interfaces and drop-down control menus has made it possible to readily use computational chemistry tools in most chemistry courses in the undergraduate curriculum. This book will focus on the use of computational chemistry as a tool in the classroom and laboratory to teach chemical principles."

We derive the Hartree-Fock equation for the 1s orbital of a realistic two-electron atom. By employing a two-dimensional basis-set representation, we avoid the use of variational calculus and are able to visualize key aspects of the method. We explain the basic self-consistent-field algorithm and provide a python script to illustrate how the algorithm works in practice. Utilizing perturbation theory, we perform an analysis of the convergence behavior of the self-consistent-field algorithm, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the numerical examples presented. We expect that this work will be useful for teaching computational techniques to physics students."

For practical reasons, it is often difficult to have students test their proposed explanation with additional measurements. To meet this need, we have written a small program which generates a sample absorption spectrum of 40 (at the time of writing) different cyanine dyes, giving students an opportunity to evaluate their hypotheses.\nWindows executable only."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This book reflects the diversity of physical chemistry experiences of the authors themselves. Some chapters provide suggestions to increase engagement by providing new, intriguing contexts such as protein interactions and surface chemistry through which to teach traditional physical chemistry concepts. Other chapters focus on pedagogy, presenting ideas on how to increase the active involvement of students in their own learning or how to help students memorize difficult thermodynamic equations. Still other chapters challenge traditional instructional notions with ideas such as using flipped classrooms and incorporating a graphic novel. In general, we organized the chapters according to these broad categories, although some chapters bridge categories.\nIn short, this book has a little bit of a lot of different things. However, there are twin unifying threads present throughout. First, this book was written by people interested in physical chemistry education who wanted to improve student learning in their classes. Second, this book was written for those who share our passions about teaching and learning physical chemistry.\nAs mentioned above, each of us has our own particular setting in which we teach our students physical chemistry. Thus, you will probably not be able to implement all the ideas from the chapters directly into your own classroom and laboratory because specific details about each author’s situation will not likely match your own. Therefore, this book is not so much a step-by-step instruction manual as it is a resource for ideas, guidance, and inspiration for improving your own physical chemistry curriculum for the purpose of engaging students."

    "text": "Of the three main subdivisions in chemistry, physical chemistry often presents a challenge when delivered to those not majoring in chemistry or its cognate disciplines. This is, at least in part, due to the seemingly unrelatedness of the subject to students’ anticipated career. We describe the redesign of a nested physical chemistry course for health science majors using a context-based learning approach. Each of the major themes of introductory physical chemistry (viz., gas laws, equilibrium, thermodynamics, kinetics, and electrochemistry) is taught and assessed using examples drawn from anesthesia. We summarize the motivations for this change and provide a range of examples demonstrating how basic physical chemistry can be related to anesthesia. The aim of this article is to provide instructors with interesting examples that they can incorporate either fully or in part into their curricula."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nowadays, many chemical investigations can be supported theoretically by routine molecular structure calculations, conformer ensembles, reaction energies, barrier heights, and predicted spectroscopic properties. Such standard computational chemistry applications are most often conducted with density functional theory (DFT) and atom-centered atomic orbital basis sets implemented in many standard quantum chemistry software packages. This work aims to provide general guidance on the various technical and methodological aspects of DFT calculations for molecular systems, and how to achieve an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency through multi-level approaches. The main points discussed are the density functional, the atomic orbital basis sets, and the computational protocol to describe and predict experimental behavior properly. This is done in three main parts: Firstly, in the form of a step-by-step decision tree to guide the overall computational approach depending on the problem; secondly, using a recommendation matrix that addresses the most critical aspects regarding the functional and basis set depending on the computational task at hand (structure optimization, reaction energy calculations, etc.); and thirdly, by applying all steps to some representative examples to illustrate the recommended protocols and effect of methodological choices."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past half century, computational chemistry has evolved from a niche field to a ubiquitous pillar of modern chemical research. Driven by the increased demand for computational chemistry in research settings, the undergraduate curriculum has evolved alongside to ensure that students are well-equipped for modern research. Toward this end, many excellent computational chemistry exercises have been developed that aim to teach students what kinds of questions computational chemistry can answer and how to properly interpret the results. However, there has been far less attention given to the complexities of determining how reliable computational results are and how constraining computational scaling can be. We present an undergraduate lab exercise that uses ab initio methods to predict the combustion energy of methane. The exercise walks students through the process of benchmarking errors on a small system (methane), estimating the computational cost to perform the same analysis on a larger system (propane), and justifying an affordable yet accurate method for a hypothetical study of the larger system. Furthermore, students are introduced to other cost-saving measures like basis set extrapolation and additive corrections. The entire exercise is intentionally designed to require little technical knowledge of computational chemistry and to be flexibly grafted into a standard undergraduate curriculum. In order to ensure accessibility, the exercise utilizes the free open source software Psi4 (available on any operating system) and provides a detailed installation and use guide for completing this lab. This lab will provide students the understanding of how to properly judge, select, and justify different computational models where cost and accuracy compete, a highly desirable set of skills that generalize to any computational science."

    "text": "An ongoing need exists for the creation of interdisciplinary working groups in the sciences and development of pedagogical approaches to content themes that tie together different scientific disciplines. The work described here addresses this need through the development of a collaborative faculty group and a process of content and pedagogical development around the central interdisciplinary theme of energy conservation and transfer, taught in various lower and upper level courses in physics, biology, and chemistry. Our main goal was to design conceptual, visual models that addressed our energy topic and allowed us to provide related, challenging, active-learning experiences that students could easily recognize and expand upon in subsequent courses as they progressed through our curriculum. We used an assessment-first approach in which we designed models with our student outcomes in mind and then created course approaches around our assessment tools. Early indications suggest that students are challenged by and appreciative of these learning approaches, especially when more advanced models are developed in advanced courses in the Physics of Medicine curriculum."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past 20 years, significant effort has been devoted to advancing the modular approach to teaching chemistry laboratory courses. The development and implementation of two modules are presented here for teaching a second-semester physical chemistry laboratory course using the modular approach: an inquiry-based module concerning proteins and a project-based module concerning organic small molecules. Each module focuses on a molecular system in question and allows participating students to choose and apply various methods to study the system in different ways, according to the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The common thrust of all of the modules is to develop students’ critical thinking skills, provide them a conduit to apply their knowledge to real applications, encourage them to model the approaches and behavior of practicing scientists, and excite them to initiate and pursue research opportunities. Details of implementation of this modular approach in teaching the second-semester physical chemistry laboratory for the past 11 years are provided. The assessment results indicate encouraging evidence that this two-level modular approach has achieved its goals and assisted students in choosing more research-based careers."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article describes an undergraduate laboratory exercise that uses optical spectroscopy to determine the magnitude and the uncertainty of the Boltzmann constant kb. The more accurate approach uses photoacoustic spectroscopy to measure the Doppler-broadened line profile of individual spectral lines of N2O to extract kb. Measurements and estimates of the uncertainties in the quantities needed to calculate kb from the line profiles are then used to estimate the uncertainty in kb. This experiment is unusual in that it uses advanced laser-based spectroscopy techniques to emphasize standard practices of uncertainty analysis. The core instrumentation is modular and relatively affordable; it requires a tunable single-mode laser, photoreceiver, optical cell, and vacuum pump. If this instrumentation is not available, an alternate approach can be performed which uses the intensity of each rotational transition of an infrared band to measure kb. Although there is more uncertainty using the alternate approach, low concentrations of CO2, DCl, or N2O give reasonable results for the magnitude of kb. Student assessment results indicate retention and mastery of the concept of combined measurement uncertainty."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When learning chemistry, students must learn to extract chemical information from mathematical expressions. However, chemistry students’ exposure to mathematics often comes primarily from pure mathematics courses, which can lead to knowledge fragmentation and potentially hinder their ability to use mathematics in chemistry. This study examines how computation can affect students’ blending of cognitive resources and their framing of mathematics in a chemical context. How students analytically and numerically interpret mathematical expressions in chemistry are examined through 14 individual clinical interviews with undergraduate chemistry students. The analysis was done by performing a thematic analysis of the interviews through a theoretical lens provided by the blended processing framework. This analysis reveals that computation and iterative thinking might serve as a catalyst for conceptual understanding and blending of cognitive resources. These findings suggest that we should evaluate how computational approaches could be leveraged to give students a better understanding of both mathematical models and the chemical concepts illustrated through these models."

    "text": "Chemistry simulations using interactive graphic user interfaces (GUI) represent uniquely effective and safe tools to support multi-dimensional learning. Computer literacy and coding skills have become increasingly important in the chemical sciences. In response to both these facts, a series of Jupyter notebooks hosted on Google Colaboratory were developed for undergraduate students enrolled in Physical Chemistry. These modules were developed for use during the COVID19 pandemic when Millsaps College courses were virtual, and only virtual or online labs could be used. These interactive exercises employ the Python programming language to explore a variety of chemical problems related to kinetics, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, numerical versus analytical solutions, and real-world application of concepts. Accessibility was prioritized and students were assumed to have no prior programming experience; the notebooks are cost-free and browser based. Students were guided to use widgets to build interactive GUIs that provide dynamic representations, immediate access to multiple investigations, and interaction with key variables. To evaluate the perceived effectiveness of this introduction to Python programming, participants were surveyed at the beginning and end of the course to gauge their interest in pursuing programming and data analysis skills and how they viewed the importance of programming and data analysis for their future careers. Student reactions were generally positive and showed increased interest in programming and its importance in their futures, so these notebooks will be incorporated into the in-person laboratory in the future.\nContent will be periodically updated to fix bugs and add and improve content.\nAnswer keys can be requested by instructors by emailing me using your school email address."

The students designed and built a double-beam photometer using their smartphones and household materials, then prepared a series of dye-solutions with well-known relative concentrations and measured the absorbance–concentration calibration curve. After 24 h of adsorption to kitchen absorbent paper the solutions were visibly decolored. The students were able to determine the equilibrium dye concentrations from absorbance measurements and to calculate the adsorption isotherm. This home-lab experiment allowed them to keep on track with their lessons during the severe lock down in Spain due to COVID-19. They were highly motivated and achieved the learning objectives to a similar degree as in years before with conventional lab equipment."

Qualitative research of the case study type was carried out. The subjects were first-year students enrolled in a general chemistry course. We employed textual documents and focus groups for data gathering and found that significantly changing the pattern of a laboratory activity, despite being a challenging and effortful task, had many benefits for the student’s development, such as increasing their connection to and proactivity toward the experiment."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper presents MATLAB user interfaces for two multiphase kinetic models: the kinetic double-layer model of aerosol surface chemistry and gas–particle interactions (K2-SURF) and the kinetic multilayer model of aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (KM-SUB). Each interface has simple and user-friendly features that allow undergraduate and graduate students in physical, environmental, and atmospheric chemistry classes to learn about multiphase chemistry modeling without prior computer programming or modeling experience. It is easy to input parameters, and the simulation results are promptly displayed in the interface; thus, these model interfaces are particularly suitable for in-classroom and homework teaching applications. The model input parameters include surface and bulk reaction rate coefficients, surface accommodation coefficient, and gas and bulk diffusivities, while model outputs include gas uptake coefficient and surface and bulk concentrations. Students can use the K2-SURF interface to simulate surface processes and the KM-SUB interface to simulate surface and bulk processes. Example simulations were performed for each interface to present atmospherically relevant applications and to demonstrate its versatility for exploring model sensitivity on various kinetic parameters. The K2-SURF interface was used to show how the rate of ozone uptake by an organic surface and temporal evolution of surface concentrations are affected by the surface accommodation coefficient, desorption lifetime, and surface reaction rate coefficient. Additionally, the KM-SUB interface was applied to demonstrate how bulk diffusivities impact the degradation kinetics of oleic acid particles, so that students can learn how the phase state (liquid vs semisolid vs glassy solid) impacts multiphase chemical kinetics. The developed K2-SURF and KM-SUB interfaces are effective tools for modeling surface and bulk reactions in college-level educational settings, helping students to obtain a deeper understanding of the complex behaviors of heterogeneous and multiphase systems."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The concepts taught in an undergraduate physical chemistry course are directly related to the molecular processes governing climate change, yet the connections between quantum mechanical molecular properties and global warming are rarely made explicit. To improve student knowledge about climate change, we developed a three-part activity that computationally and experimentally explores blackbody radiation, the greenhouse effect, and the relationship between IR absorption properties and global warming potentials for the anthropogenic greenhouse gases defined in the Paris Agreement. The activities addressed the traditional learning objectives of a quantum-focused physical chemistry course by exploring topics such as the quantized nature of energy in Planck’s Law, the selection rules for rovibrational transitions, and discrepancies between theoretical models and observed experimental results. However, our approach was unique in that each concept was addressed within the context of the atmospheric phenomena related to climate change. A previously published climate science survey instrument was administered pre- and postactivity to assess student learning gains. The average percent of correct responses on this survey increased from 44% to 68% as a result of completing the activities.\nThe activities focused on (1) blackbody radiation and the greenhouse effect, (2) collection and interpretation of the IR spectrum of carbon dioxide, and (3) calculation of the GWPs of several anthropogenic greenhouse gases based on IR vibrational intensities generated from density functional theory (DFT) calculations."

    "title": "An Upper Level Laboratory Exercise to Explore Computational Predictions of Regiochemistry in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) represents an important class of reactions taught in the undergraduate organic chemistry curriculum. The EAS reaction of benzene and its substituted derivatives is generally described as proceeding through a carbocation (arenium cation) intermediate, and the regiochemistry of the product is heavily influenced by the nature of the substituents. Molecular properties such as frontier molecular orbitals, Hirshfeld charges, and 13C and 1H NMR shifts can predict the directing nature of the substituents. In this upper level laboratory experiment, students calculate these molecular properties to predict the regiochemistry of various aromatic systems. Mono- and disubstituted benzene systems are used to introduce the computational workflow, as these systems are typically covered in an introductory organic chemistry course and their properties yield unambiguous predictions. Then students apply this methodology to unfamiliar systems by predicting the regiochemistry of heteroaromatic molecules including poly substituted and fused-ring systems. The molecular properties for some of these systems yield multiple reasonable predictions, so students must weigh the data to argue where substitution will occur, incorporating additional concepts such as steric effects. By the end of this experiment, students should understand the ways in which several molecular properties aid in predicting regiochemistry for EAS reactions and gain a greater appreciation for the possibilities of using computational chemistry to study reactivity."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In general, for an organic compound a plot of the log vapor pressure versus inverse temperature is linear over a wide temperature range. This however can lead to a point of confusion in an undergraduate thermodynamics course. This linear behavior is typically explained using the Clausius/Clapeyron equation. That is, starting with the Clapeyron equation one first assumes (1) that change in compressibility upon vaporization is approximately 1, or equivalently that the vapor phase may be treated as an ideal gas where the molar volume of the vapor is much greater than that of the liquid, which may be assumed negligible. And second (2), that the enthalpy of vaporization is constant. While the resulting linear behavior is captured, the underlying assumptions are not applicable over the wide range of temperature of interest. Here we discuss the shortcomings of the conventional explanation of the Clausius/Clapeyron equation. We further demonstrate that a simple solution is to instead assume that the enthalpy of vaporization relative to the change in compressibility upon vaporization is constant. We provide a series of examples and MATLAB code that can be used in an undergraduate thermodynamics course."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A spreadsheet-based exercise for students is described in which they are challenged to explain and reproduce the disparate temperature dependencies of the heat capacities of gaseous F\\(_2\\) and N\\(_2\\). For F\\(_2\\), C\\(_{p,m}\\) increases from 300 K, reaches a maximum at 2200 K, and then decreases to 74% of the maximum value at 6000 K, while C\\(_{p,m}\\) for N\\(_2\\) rises monotonically in this temperature range. Students compare this behavior with the prediction of the equipartition principle and then test four models with increasing sophistication, from closed-form expressions of the harmonic/anharmonic oscillator–rigid/nonrigid rotor to calculations using discrete sums over rovibrational states, all using molecular spectroscopic constants. Fundamental principles of statistical thermodynamics are used to calculate the partition functions, which yield the internal energy, heat capacity, and third-law entropy of the molecules. They encounter the need to include the role of quasibound rotational states that arise from the rotational barrier to molecular dissociation and to employ methods for truncating the sums used in the partition functions. In this exercise, students confront the fact that, for N\\(_2\\), C\\(_{p,m}\\) continues to rise, reaching a maximum at 16,000 K that is 1.8 times the equipartition value. The inclusion of electronically excited states in the partition function is discussed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The reemergence of virtual reality (VR) in the last few years has led to affordable commodity hardware that can offer new ways to teach, communicate and engage with difficult concepts, especially those which involve complicated 3D motion and spatial manipulation. In a higher education context, these immersive technologies make it possible to teach complex molecular topics in a way that may aid or even supersede traditional approaches such as molecular models, textbook images, and traditional screen-based computational environments. In this work we describe a study involving 24 third-year UK undergraduate chemistry students who undertook a traditional computational chemistry class complemented with an additional component utilising real-time interactive molecular dynamics simulations in VR (iMD-VR). Exploiting the flexibility of an open-source iMD-VR framework which we recently described,(1) and building on recent work where we demonstrated the ability to use this framework to run ‘on-the-fly’ density functional theory in VR at interactive speeds,2 we designed three tasks for students to complete in iMD-VR: (1) interactive rearrangement of the chorismate molecule to prephenate using forces obtained from ‘on-the-fly’ density functional theory calculations; (2) unbinding of chorismate from the active site chorismate mutase enzyme using molecular-mechanics forces calculated in real-time; and (3) docking of chorismate with chorismate mutase using real-time molecular mechanics forces. A survey indicated that most students found the iMD-VR component more engaging than the traditional approach, and also that it improved their perceived educational outcomes and their interest in continuing on in the field of computational sciences."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ultrafast laser spectroscopy is a valuable and increasingly accessible technique for studies of rapid chemical reactions. Critical to ultrafast spectroscopy is the concept of mode-locking, a technique that enables a fixed phase relationship between laser modes, resulting in laser pulses with very short duration (in the fs or ps range). Despite an increasing importance of ultrafast lasers in chemistry, the introduction of key concepts behind their operation into the undergraduate and graduate chemistry coursework has been limited. To help the incorporation of these topics into chemistry courses, we report here a hands-on activity that helps students develop an intuitive understanding of the factors that impact electromagnetic wave evolution in optical cavities and the process of mode-locking. We first provide the theoretical background by introducing cavity modes and contrasting them with well-known propagating electromagnetic waves. We then explore what happens when modes are added and how the relative phase between the modes affect their behavior. In the second section of the manuscript, three teaching modules are provided, along with associated Matlab codes and animated images, that can be used in the classroom to introduce concepts of cavity modes and mode-locking. These teaching modules start by contrasting propagating electromagnetic waves with cavity modes, then illustrate what happens when multiple modes are present in the cavity and how the relative phase between the modes affects the overall electromagnetic fields in the cavity."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A central element of courses on thermodynamics at universities are the fundamentals of thermophysical property behavior. Thermophysical properties are often complex functions of at least two variables that comprise phase equilibria, metastable phases, critical points, etc. The thermal and caloric property behavior, e.g., \\(p = p(v, T)\\) and \\(c_v = c_v(T, v)\\), of pure substances and vapor–liquid phase equilibria of binary mixtures (pTx) are classical examples. A good spatial imagination is necessary for a complete understanding of the relations of the different properties and different phase regions. In this work, we explore how 3D printing can be used for visualizing thermophysical properties more vividly than classical 2D plots. This is tested using different thermodynamic property examples, e.g., the \\(p = p(v, T)\\) surface of a pure substance with highlights for the binodal, spinodal, critical point, and characteristic isotherms. Also, three-dimensional objects describing fluid phase equilibria in binary mixtures are considered, e.g., azeotropic mixtures. The data for the 3D prints was obtained in this work from molecular-based equations of state. The 3D printed objects aim at providing the students vivid access to the relations and the behavior of thermophysical properties. We report on the first positive experiences using such 3D printed thermophysical properties in teaching.\n\nReference\nKatharina Koehler, Johann Seibert, Gabriele Hornung, Simon Stephan, J. Chem.

In the first component, students prepared analyte solutions from over-the-counter aspirin tablets and a relevant number of standards (n = 9–10) through both serial and parallel dilutions. In the second component, the ASA concentrations of three over-the-counter formulations (325 mg per tablet) were determined with percent differences as small as 1.1% using the Beer–Lambert law and external calibration curves. In the third component, students evaluated the reaction order (pseudo-first order), the rate constant (e.g., k = 3.0 × 10–4 s–1 at 75°C), and the activation energy (Ea ∼ 67.3 kJ mol–1) of the hydrolysis reaction of ASA at various temperatures (e.g., 25, 37, 50, 75, and 85°C). The last component was completed using a student-centered instructional approach, namely, process-oriented guided-inquiry learning (POGIL), which helped refine students’ research process skills and both basic and in-depth laboratory skills (weighing, solution handling, micropipetting, operation of a pH meter and a modern, benchtop absorption spectrophotometer). The student and instructor evaluations indicated a positive learning experience and high interest in this laboratory that was inspired by the quality control and quality assurance of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nReference\nVictoire Delattre, Remi Olivier Labeille, Nicholas Slade Shropshire, Kyra Grace Kaiser, Brent Kirkland, Keith Zvoch, Ioana Emilia Pavel, J.

    "text": "Molecules and materials often display distributed heterogeneous properties. Modeling the behavior of a single molecule with these properties (e.g. via Monte-Carlo simulations) requires a rapid way to sample distributions of interest and describe how they evolve. Here, we pedagogically introduce a simple algorithm that converts evenly distributed random number generator outputs to any defined probability density function (PDF) called the Random Number Converter (RNC). We demonstrate a numerical approach to obtain cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and utilize a binary search algorithm to circumvent the need for analytical inverse CDFs. This simple method is demonstrated for various distributions, including single-exponential and Gaussian distributions and non-standard PDFs, for which neither the CDF nor its inverse are analytically solvable. We then apply this algorithm to the rate analysis of catalytic turnover cycles and Fourier spectroscopy, enabling the study of complex reaction kinetics and retrospective interferometry analysis. Our algorithm and examples can be used to train undergraduates on the tools that underlay Monte Carlo methods and connect physical chemistry to standard computer science and statistics. We provide a MATLAB and Python module in the Supporting Information with customizable parameters.\n\nReference\nLi B (Yangtao), Duong T, Neuhauser D, Alexandrova AN, Caram JR., ChemRxiv, 2024; 10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4thlz-v2\nThis content is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-ND 4.0"

Before the introduction of the project, the lectures covered quantum chemistry, spectroscopy, and kinetics while simultaneously including computational chemistry and introductory experiments utilizing Avogadro and ORCA software as the laboratory part of the course. The scientific goals for the project were (1) to benchmark different computational methods regarding accuracy and efficiency in reproducing experimental data (structure and IR spectra) for cytosine and flucytosine molecules and (2) to estimate the energy difference between products and reactants and obtain the transition state. Additionally, we aimed to foster students’ independent thinking and application of previously learned methods to a new problem. The work was initially divided evenly among students, and 2 weeks of class time or laboratory periods were solely dedicated to the project, in which students worked independently with the professor’s presence as a facilitator. Students uploaded data to a shared Google Folder and made group presentations at the end. The project proved beneficial in several ways, including promoting collaborative work and problem-solving skills while sparking students’ interest in further research.\n\nReference\nMonsurat M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study aims to give chemistry students a deeper understanding of electron shielding and quantum transitions by interpreting the characteristic X-ray lines. There is a popular misunderstanding among learners and even teachers in which an outer-shell electron fills a vacancy in the inner shell, releasing some of its energy as an X-ray photon. However, this picture gives an unsatisfactory prediction of characteristic X-ray lines. In fact, electron transition is a collective process. During the transition of one electron, the states of all of the electrons in the system change together due to the change in shielding between the electrons. By using the effective nuclear charges calculated with Slater’s rules, formulas for Kα lines are derived, which fit experimental data very well. The formulas are also compared to Moseley’s law to explain its success and limitations. The introduction of the ideas and methods and the students’ research projects significantly improve the understanding of the concepts related to atomic structure, quantum states, and quantum transition and the students’ problem-solving skills.\n\nReference\nRuifeng Zhou, Journal of Chemical Education Article ASAP, doi:10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00396\n\n\n\n\nReuse©2024 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc."

Interestingly, ChatGPT’s free version provides accurate responses to discipline-specific questions that contain information from unrelated topics as distractors, improving its accuracy over the free-response questions.

In the first exercise, students dug into the theoretical foundations of surface wetting by deriving and interpreting Young’s, Wenzel’s, and Cassie–Baxter’s equations. The second exercise involved digital experiments wherein students observed changes in wetting properties on different nanopatterned surface structures via an online app. Finally, the third exercise presented a nanoscale model using a wetting parameter to enhance students’ understanding of surface wetting at the molecular level. Student learning outcome evaluations revealed that this hands-on integrative approach substantially improved students’ understanding of surface wetting concepts. Students obtained a comprehensive understanding of surface wetting by deriving wetting models, visualizing contact angle variations in digital experiments, and linking these to a nanoscale wetting parameter. Moreover, students expressed greater confidence and enthusiasm for tackling complex topics in surface science and research.\n\nReference\nRong An, Ruizhe Zeng, Junsen Huang, Feng Xu, Haibo Zeng, Zhongyang Dai, Faiz Ullah Shah, Aatto Laaksonen, Si Lan, J.

This study aims to delineate the design and construction of mind maps to facilitate student comprehension regarding the thermodynamic description of multicomponent systems. Students’ responses to test exercises related to general formulas and their derivation of formulas served as primary data sources for analysis. The findings indicate that nearly all students successfully derived and applied thermodynamic formulas using guided mind mapping techniques. Furthermore, while mind mapping can help students engage with connections between chapters across different contexts, it may not sufficiently address the deeper understanding of individual concepts. Therefore, it is imperative for educators to elucidate the derivation process for key formulas by demonstrating “how this is accomplished”. By emphasizing interconnections between chapters, encouraging practice with newly acquired concepts alongside previously mastered knowledge, and fostering repeated reflection through practice, students can progressively attain a more integrated state of understanding. Ultimately, it is concluded that the guided mind mapping approach can effectively support comprehensive learning among students regarding the thermodynamic description of multicomponent systems.\n\nReference\nLe Luo, J.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Specifications grading is an alternative grading system that has been used with increasing frequency in higher education. Since first introduced by Linda Nilson in 2014, more than 91 publications on the design and implementation of specifications grading systems have been published. This work presents a systematic review of the current literature to analyze the variety of ways specifications grading systems are executed, including the diverse design and implementation considerations, as well as to present and discuss emergent themes. We analyzed 91 publications and present their relevant findings in the results. The following databases were last searched on October 5, 2024, for publications: IEEE Xplore, ACS Publications, ASEE PEER, PER, Scopus, ERIC, ACM, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. All peer-reviewed journal articles, conference proceedings, and book chapters that implemented at least two structural features of specifications grading in an undergraduate or graduate course were included in this review. Theses, dissertations, conference abstracts, posters, workshops, blogs, opinion pieces, social media exchanges, and content provided on websites were not included. Additionally, reports of specifications grading systems in K-12 courses or those that only presented the design and/or implementation of less than two structural features of the grading system were similarly excluded. Our findings from the literature reveal that the following themes emerge from educators who use specifications grading: time investment, academic performance, and student reactions. This review provides a resource for those interested in exploring this alternative grading system, and the emergent themes indicate that there are ripe opportunities for future study.\n\nReference\nHowitz W.J., McKnelly K.J., Link R.D., ChemRxiv, 2024, doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-d0tf6-v2.

    "text": "The laboratory is a complex environment where the three levels of the chemistry triplet coincide. As the laboratory environment places a large demand on the working memory of students, cognitive load theory can address overload which causes barriers to learning. Breaking down barriers requires iterative phases of analysis/exploration, design/construction and evaluation/reflection over multiple cycles which are the hallmarks of design-based research. In a complex setting, managing change and redressing teaching approaches can be difficult to navigate. Design-based research incorporates iterative phases in which theory informs decision making. This paper uses the context of a laboratory exercise of emission spectra to illustrate how the cognitive load theory can be used in tandem with design-based research to support student learning in the exercise. Using this approach, it was possible to show how barriers to student understanding, including task demands and conceptual demands were supported through proposed approaches focusing on extraneous, intrinsic and ultimately germane cognitive load.\n\nReference\nMundy, Christine E. and Potgieter, Marietjie and Seery, Michael K., Chem.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Productive problem solving, concept construction, and sense making occur through the core process of abstraction. Although the capacity for domain-general abstraction is developed at a young age, the role of abstraction in increasingly complex and disciplinary environments, such as those encountered in undergraduate STEM education, is not well understood. Undergraduate physical chemistry relies particularly heavily on abstraction because it uses many overlapping and imperfect mathematical models to represent and interpret phenomena occurring on multiple scales; however, studying and identifying abstraction in-the-moment in physical chemistry is challenging, because current conceptions of abstraction neglect the domain-specific features. This work uses an approach guided by informed grounded theory to develop a conceptual framework that makes abstraction in physical chemistry problem solving visible. Problem solving teaching interviews with individuals and pairs (n = 18) on thermodynamics and kinetics topics are analyzed using an abductive approach. The resulting Epistemic Actions of Abstraction framework characterizes eight epistemic actions along two dimensions: increasing abstractness relative to the context (concretizing, manipulating, restructuring, and generalizing) and nature of the object the action operates on (conceptual or symbolic). These actions are used to identify two types of abstraction: horizontal and vertical abstraction. We discuss how abstraction in problem solving is contextually dependent and implications this work has for problem solving in physical chemistry, as well as implications for physical chemistry instruction.\n\nReference\nJessica M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is this experiment about?\n\nSoluble ionic compounds produce ions when they dissociate in water and this process may absorb or release thermal energy. In this experiment students measure the temperature change upon dissolution of ionic compounds. They calculate the heat absorbed or released and then relate it to the molar solution enthalpy of the ionic compound. In this experiment, students learn the method of solution calorimetry and use it to measure solution enthalpies. Students use their measured solution enthalpies and the Born-Mayer equation as a model to calculate lattice enthalpies, which exhibit periodic trends. Any introduction to calorimetry in previous lab courses is sufficient for this experiment.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nStudents use a coffee-cup calorimeter, and/or a more advanced solution calorimeter, to observe temperature changes when a salt dissolves in water. Students construct thermograms and calibrate their calorimeter to determine solution enthalpies for salts of monatomic ions. Students use the Born-Mayer equation as a model to construct lattice enthalpies that exhibit periodic trends. Students then explore, interpret, and consider extending periodic trends in lattice enthalpies of monatomic ions.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\n\nCoffee-cup calorimeter consisting of a styrofoam coffee-cup, magnetic stirrer, and thermometer, or a dedicated solution calorimeter, with analytical balances recommended\nAnhydrous salts of alkali metal halides (such as NaCl) work well in this experiment. Some alkali metal salts are very hygroscopic and may require dehydration to avoid waters of hydration.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nStudents connect their general chemistry concepts of enthalpy, lattice energy, Hess’ Law, and periodic trends, using the more rigorous physical chemistry model of the Born-Mayer equation. Students use the method of solution calorimetry with careful calibration and detailed analysis of thermogram plots to observe the process of thermal equilibrium and to more accurately determine enthalpy changes in an aqueous solution at constant pressure. Students construct lattice energies from measured solution enthalpies using Hess’ Law. Lattice energies are then compared to theoretical results of the Born-Mayer equation.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents make predictions and develop hypotheses about whether dissolution of specific salts will be exothermic or endothermic processes. Students engage in experimental design to establish a consistent and accurate protocol for measurement and analysis of time and temperature data, and in decision making to assign salts to student teams for reproducibility. Students process information by applying graphical analysis and the Born-Mayer equation with Hess’ Law to obtain lattice enthalpies. Finally, students share data to develop a fuller picture of periodic trends in lattice enthalpies. Students demonstrate understanding of periodic trends by extending these concepts to salts of polyatomic ions.\n\n\nReference\nLead authors: Matt Scanlon, Fairmont State University and Rob Whitnell, Guilford College\nView student handout\nThe Instructor’s Handbook with implementation details, sample data, and expected answers is available through the POGIL-PCL project.\nHighlight author: Christine Morales, University of Mount Union"

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is this experiment about?\n\nPhysical chemistry students are often interested in biological applications, and protein denaturation is a system that is readily accessible in the physical chemistry lab. This experiment focuses on the myoglobin-guanidine system where the presence of the strong denaturant guanidine can be seen in the effect on the visible spectrum of myoglobin. Performing these experiments allow students to apply their knowledge of free energy and equilibrium to this biophysical system.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nPre-experiment questions have students research key properties of myoglobin, guanidine, and buffer solutions. In the first experiment cycle, each student team selects three concentrations of guanidine and examines the effect on myoglobin structure as seen in the visible spectrum. The class uses all data to discern patterns in myoglobin behavior that motivate the second cycle. Each team then performs measurements with multiple guanidine concentrations to elucidate the transition between folded and unfolded myoglobin. Using the relation between K and ∆G, students can show how ∆G depends on guanidine concentration and identify a critical concentration where folded and unfolded myoglobin is present in equal concentrations. In doing so, students use both linear and non-linear fitting methods for data analysis. The experiment can be completed in two lab periods.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\nStock solutions of myoglobin (1 mg/mL) and guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl, 6M), both in pH 7 phosphate buffer; students can alternately be given myoglobin to make their own solutions. Each team typically uses 25-50 mL of myoglobin solution and 50-100 of GuHCl solution. Visible spectrometer capable of measuring absorbance values in the range 0-2. Volumetric pipettes or flasks for handling small volumes.\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nThe experiment provides a substantial introduction to the application of physical chemistry concepts to a biochemical system. The approach is one of ∆∆G, where the change in [GuHCl] affects ∆G for the myoglobin denaturation process. Students gain experience in precise solution preparation and spectroscopic measurements and in both linear and non-linear fitting of data. They are introduced to the sigmoid function as a way of modeling the kind of rapid change in equilibrium present in this system.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nBefore performing any experiments, students make predictions about how denaturant concentration affects protein structure that they test in the experiment. The experiment requires substantial data sharing and reaching consensus with other students in making decisions about the experimental process so that sufficient data is collected. Students use both graphical representations and linear and non-linear mathematical models to analyze their results and plan further experiments. They demonstrate their understanding of the underlying concepts in post-experiment questions that analyze the system further.\n\n\nReference\nLead authors: Ruthanne Paradise, University of Massachusetts Amhearst, and Sally Hunnicutt Virginia Commonwealth University.\nView student version\nThe Instructor’s Handbook with implementation details, sample data, and expected answers is available through the POGIL-PCL project.\nHighlight author: Rob Whitnell\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0"

With the cancellation of in-person classes, laboratory experiences were delayed and/or moved to the virtual space, the latter keeping the general framework of the laboratory experiment but removing the benchwork. In this program assessment, we used a set of timed surveys to assess the effects of delayed physical lab experiences and how an in-person inquiry-based laboratory project influences student self-efficacy in an undergraduate analytical chemistry class. Almost three-quarters of the students in this course had never had an in-person laboratory experience in college prior to this semester; many students shared feelings of anxiety and trepidation when approaching the laboratory experience in this intermediate-level chemistry course. In general, &gt;95% of students self-reported feeling higher confidence after completing the project lab experience. Overall, this program assessment brought to light the negative effects brought by delayed physical laboratory experiences in returning to in-person opportunities, especially postpandemic.\n\nReference\nAmanda Rae Buchberger, Jericha Mill, J.

Respondents were asked to rate the level of choice their students had in deciding six key characteristics of the experiments used in their course (e.g., what research questions to explore); the more choices students get to make, the more inquiry-based instructional experience. MANOVA and post hoc analyses suggest that there are differences in the level of inquiry across chemistry course levels; lower-level courses (i.e., general chemistry and organic chemistry) implement lower levels of inquiry-based laboratory instruction compared to upper-level courses (i.e. more chemistry major-focused courses). We found no evidence of association between the level of inquiry courses and institutions’ highest chemistry degree awarded, American Chemical Society approval to award certified bachelors degrees, or external funding to transform postsecondary chemistry courses. Our study contributes to the chemical education community’s growing understanding of the state of postsecondary chemistry laboratory instruction. Results further suggest that there is an opportunity for faculty members and department leaders to reflect on their instructional laboratory courses and implement more inquiry-based instructional laboratory experiences across the entirety of the postsecondary chemistry curriculum.\n\nReference\nZammit, Kendall M.; Connor, Megan C.; Raker, Jeffrey R.; Chem.

A purposeful sampling strategy was used to recruit a diverse group of faculty for interviews. Collectively, the participating faculty regularly teach or have taught physical chemistry courses in 16 different chemistry departments in the United States. While faculty agreed that the goal of teaching physical chemistry was to help students develop robust conceptual knowledge of the subject matter within thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, chemical kinetics, and other major topics, some articulated strong beliefs about epistemic and social learning goals. An understanding of the relations between different ways of thinking about teaching upper-division physical chemistry courses offers practitioners with alternative perspectives that may help them expand their awareness of the purposes for teaching physical chemistry in the undergraduate curriculum. Furthermore, knowledge of faculty beliefs about their teaching provides educational researchers and curriculum developers with an understanding about the potential opportunities or barriers for helping faculty align their beliefs and goals for teaching with research-based instructional strategies.

That an excited state will have a different pKa than the ground state is a new concept for students.

    "text": "Entropy and the second law of thermodynamics have long been identified as difficult concepts to teach in the physical chemistry curriculum. Their highly abstract nature, mathematical complexity and emergent nature underscore the necessity to better link classical thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics. The objectives of this systematic review are thus to scope the solutions suggested by the literature to improve entropy teaching. ERIC and SCOPUS databases were searched for articles aiming primarily at this objective, generating N = 315 results. N = 91 articles were selected, among which N = 9 reported quantitative experimental data and underwent a meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed by the standards criteria of What Works Clearinghouse. Results from the qualitative selection show diverse solutions to solve the entropy teaching hurdles, such as connection to everyday life, visualization, mathematics management by demonstrations, games and simulations, criticism and replacement of the disorder metaphor and curriculum assessment. The synthetic meta-analysis results show high but uncertain effect sizes. Implications for teachers and researchers are discussed.\n\nReference\nNatalis, Vincent and Leyh, Bernard, Chem. Educ. Res.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The integration of electronic structure theory (EST) calculations with Python programming and cheminformatics tools presents a unique opportunity for enhancing chemistry education. This study shows how integrating Gaussian calculations with Python programming and libraries can be an effective approach for teaching computational chemistry. We present a comprehensive approach that bridges the gap between graphical user interface (GUI) interactions and programming in computational chemistry education. Our method introduces common calculations using Gaussian 16, demonstrating molecule generation, geometry optimization, and property prediction. We go beyond GUI interactions by providing complementary Python code that automates and expands these processes including scripts for generating Gaussian input files from various molecular representations. To enhance educational value, we incorporate implementations for generating molecular derivatives using RDKit and SURGE, enabling students to systematically explore structural variations. We demonstrate the integration of these tools in a practical example involving the analysis of explosive derivatives. This work also outlines several project ideas that utilize these integrated tools, providing a framework for educators to incorporate these methods into their chemistry curricula. Overall, we emphasize understanding the underlying principles of computer-based calculations and the importance of developing computational literacy through hands-on code development and customization in computational chemistry education. By integrating EST calculations with both commercial (Gaussian) and open-source (PySCF) packages, Python programming, and cheminformatics tools, this approach aims to develop students as not just software users but as computational chemists who understand the underlying principles and can adapt various EST platforms to tackle novel chemical challenges.\n\nReference\nDongseok Han, Hojin Han, Edward Chen, Walter J.

Through visualization of multiple scenarios, students learn about parity and its consequences, tunneling and delocalization, the size and quality of the basis set, and the effect of boundaries and potential surface curvature on ground state probabilities. Chemical applications include ammonia inversion, light absorption by cyanine dyes, and vibrational transitions in HCl.

    "text": "These two activities provide similar introductions to biomolecular visualization using the Protein Data Bank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org) and the VMD molecular visualization application (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) They were developed for a biochemistry class, but they should also be useful for students interested in biophysical applications, perhaps as part of a physical chemistry or computational chemistry course. While written for VMD, activities can be modified to use different molecular visualization programs.\n“When do we call a peptide a protein?” addresses specific properties of proteins and whether relatively small peptides, as small as 10 amino acids, can be said to have those properties. The activity sets a foundation in using visualization in biophysical applications. Physical chemistry students will also see how difficult it can be to provide a single, rigorous definition for a commonly-used and very significant concept. That’s a recurring theme in physical chemistry. Students also examine the characteristics of protein and peptide structures determined using NMR experiments as compared to X-ray crystallography.\n“What are the characteristics of a folded protein?” is a revision of the first activity that can be done on its own or in conjunction with an experiment examining the unfolding of bovine serum albumin in the presence of a fluorophore (Carlson, T. M., et al. “Naked-Eye Detection of Reversible Protein Folding and Unfolding in Aqueous Solution”, J. Chem. Educ. 2017, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00507). In this activity, students examine the albumin structure in the absence of any binding molecules and bound with naproxen. Students then explore the ability of albumin to bind an incredibly wide variety of small molecules, examining specifically how the fluorophore might bind to albumin based on existing albumin structures in the PDB that include a bound molecule.\nThese activities were used in a lab setting; teams could generally complete everything up to the last application part of each lab in a single three-hour lab period. The last part was assigned as work to be done outside of lab. Depending on student motivation or efficiency, instructors can make sure students understand the protocols in class, and then assign the remainder as homework.\nThe author welcomes feedback on these activities and is interested in collaboration on improving them as well as improving an activity under development in which students visualize and explore the catalytic triad in proteases.\n\nActivities\nIntro to biomolecular visualization: When do we call a peptide a protein\nIntro to biomolecular visualization: What are the characteristics of a folded protein\n\n\nAuthor\nRob Whitnell, Guilford College, Greensboro, NC, USA\n\n\nLicense\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is this experiment about?\nStudents extend prior experience with chemical kinetics to the heterogeneous process of the oxidation of solid magnesium by dilute hydrochloric acid. Experimental design is a major component of the experiment. Students first do exploratory experiments to evaluate the measurable property and the form of solid magnesium they should use. Students then obtain rate data and calculate kinetics parameters. In the final cycle, students determine the activation energy.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nIn the first cycle, students react several forms of solid magnesium with dilute hydrochloric acid and measure the initial rate of hydrogen gas production. Data analysis helps identify the measurable property of magnesium that determines the reaction rate. They then choose the form of magnesium they should use for the remainder of the experiment. The second cycle introduces the rate law for the experiment. Students perform multiple kinetics runs varying the appropriate measurable properties of the solid magnesium and the dilute hydrochloric acid. Questions guide students in determining the kinetics parameters. A final cycle has students review the Arrhenius equation and design and perform experiments to evaluate the activation energy.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\n\nSolid magnesium (required: ribbon; at least one of: powder, turnings, rod)\n1M HCl(aq) that students can dilute for use in their experiments\nGas pressure sensor, such as from Vernier\nConstant temperature bath (room temperature to 45°C is sufficient)\n125 mL Erlenmeyer flask as the reaction vessel, volumetric glassware, balances, thermometers\n\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nThe experiment illustrates how physical chemists make decisions about experiment parameters to obtain reliable results and build models for chemical behavior. Students first apply previous kinetics concepts to heterogeneous systems, making choices about forms of solid magnesium to use based on analysis of exploratory experiments. Once they have the rate law and kinetics parameters, they connect those to the Arrhenius equation that can describe the temperature dependence of the reaction rate.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents begin with experiment design, discussing the measurable properties that can affect reaction rate and making decisions about running experiments to explore those properties. They make predictions about how reactant properties or external conditions, such as temperature, affect reaction rates. In order to explore the possible parameters, including forms of solid magnesium, students share data and interact with their peers to obtain reliable results and conclusions. Students use graphical representations (initial rate determination) and mathematical models (the Arrhenius equation) in drawing conclusions.\n\n\nReference\nHunnicutt, S.

    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) are positioned to transform how students interact with data in classroom and laboratory settings, both now and in the future. The integration of LLMs into chemical curricula, if done effectively, may improve student equity and learning outcomes and provide an alternative approach to data analysis alongside traditional methods. One of the key strengths of LLMs is their ability to efficiently summarize large data sets and transform them into understandable forms. Although the ability of LLMs to help students process qualitative data is well established, here we focus on use of LLMs to process quantitative data and, specifically, make high-quality data plots without relying exclusively on spreadsheet skills. Specifically, we tested the ability of OpenAI’s ChatGPT to plot Walsh diagrams relevant to an ongoing laboratory experiment conducted in an undergraduate inorganic chemistry course. It was found that the LLM could generate high-quality graphs from raw data with appropriate prompts. Furthermore, the LLM was able to parse long computational output files to extract relevant data as well as perform multivariate linear regression. A pilot experiment integrating LLMs as a tool to generate graphs from complex data sets into a 300-level inorganic chemistry laboratory showed that ∼60% of the students considered LLMs as an efficient tool for data analysis, ∼40% felt the tool significantly enhanced their learning, and ∼5% experienced frustration. Introducing LLMs as a supplementary tool for data processing could help students who struggle with spreadsheet software without replacing essential spreadsheet skills that are fundamental to training the STEM workforce. Implementation of LLMs as a data processing tool may bring about equitable outcomes in quantitative chemistry courses regardless of students’ prior experience with spreadsheet software.\n\nReference\nS.

Mathematics teaching software GeoGebra was utilized for graphing and comparing the derived mathematic model with experimental data. Following the activity, students’ learning outcomes were evaluated using a questionnaire. The average score was 86.87 for the first round of students and 88.26 for the second round of students. Incorporating mathematical modeling of cooling curves into physical chemistry laboratory teaching has resulted in noticeable enhancement in the student’s learning. Overall, this activity effectively enhanced students’ comprehension of mathematical modeling, computational skills, and problem solving skills. The activity significantly enriches students’ comprehensive understanding of cooling curves and associated experiments in physical chemistry.\n\nReference\nBojun Shi, Ruixin Liao, Yuai Duan, Jing Yuan, Zhanfang Ma, J.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We describe an experiment in which students use research-grade instrumentation to collect gas adsorption data in triplicate in a single 3 h laboratory period. The experiment reinforces the thermodynamic concepts taught in upper level physical chemistry courses and hands-on experience with instrumentation used in research laboratories. The speed of the experiment compared to most adsorption studies makes this experiment well-suited to large physical chemistry laboratory programs. Students collect partial nitrogen adsorption isotherms from three samples of commercial carbon black N660 and apply their knowledge of BET adsorption theory to calculate the surface area of their samples. Students then compare their results to values published in literature or by manufacturers. In the course of teaching this experiment, the BET surface areas of 30 carbon black N660 samples were obtained in separate experiments in a recent semester, giving a mean surface area of 33.2 ± 0.6 m2/g (95% C.I.), versus a literature value of 33.0 m2/g. Carbon black N660 was chosen as the adsorbent in this study because it is common, has wide availability, and has relatively low surface area which allows samples to be prepared, degassed, and analyzed in a single 3 h lab period. The student learning objectives of this experiment include, as part of a written lab report, to demonstrate an understanding of the adsorption process and of BET theory, present data in tables and figures, use statistical techniques (confidence intervals) for comparison to literature, and follow and properly describe a complicated operating procedure.\n\nReference\nJoshua H.

    "text": "The rise of digital technologies since the second half of the 20th century has transformed every aspect of our lives and has had an ongoing effect even on one of the most conservative fields, education, including chemistry education. During the Covid-19 pandemic, chemistry teachers around the world were forced to teach remotely. This situation provided the authors with an opportunity to investigate how chemistry teachers integrate technology into their teaching, compared with how the research literature suggests that it is done. The theoretical framework used in this explorative qualitative study involves chemistry teachers’ technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). In particular, the study focused on different modes of technology integration (MOTIs) in chemistry teaching, which is a part of the teachers’ TPACK. In the first stage, five expert chemistry teachers were interviewed so that they could share their extensive experience with technology during online chemistry teaching. Analysis of their interviews revealed that the teachers applied 7 MOTIs in their chemistry teaching. Of these MOTIs, 4 were reported in the chemistry teaching literature: (1) using digital tools for visualization, (2) using open digital databases, (3) using computational methods, and (4) using virtual laboratories and videos of chemical experiments. In addition, the interviews revealed three new MOTIs in chemistry teaching not previously reported: (5) supporting multi-level representations, (6) enabling outreach of chemistry research, and (7) presenting chemistry in everyday life phenomena. In the second research stage, we collected the perspectives of other chemistry teachers (N = 22) regarding the 7 MOTIs. This stage enabled us to validate the findings of the first stage on a wider population and provided data to rate the importance of the seven different MOTIs according to the teachers. We wish to stress that understanding the MOTIs will not only enrich teachers’ theoretical knowledge base regarding integrating technology into chemistry teaching—it will also contribute to chemistry teachers’ preparation and professional development programs.\n\nReference\nAroch, Katchevich, and Blonder, Chem.

While the practical demonstration of charge transfer mechanisms and kinetics in laboratories can be challenging, the microscopic origins of such processes are even more complex to observe. We introduce an ab initio quantum chemistry computation practice to unravel the intricacies of CT at the molecular scale. Using the “Koopmans’ theorem–energy splitting in dimer” (KT-ESD) method and the 4-point method, the electronic coupling and reorganization energy (ROE) have been obtained in series of model molecules. Through the analysis of the electronic coupling and ROE, we discern the pivotal factors of molecular structure impacting charge transfer rates. Particularly, the results from this practice align with cutting edge experimental measurements from single-molecule conducting and photoelectron spectroscopy. This computational lab module provides a valuable instrument for comprehending charge transfer rates, thereby fostering enhanced learning experiences across major chemistry courses such as kinetics, physical chemistry, quantum chemistry, and organic chemistry.\n\nReference\nYacong Fan, Jing Du, Wentao Zhao, Xiaofei Ma, and Xi Yu, Journal of Chemical Education, Article ASAP DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00286\n\n\n\n\nReuse©2024 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc."

The time required for different charged species (ions, micelles, solid colloid particles) to reach the terminal, drift velocity, and the distance the species moves in that time are estimated in a simple way based on the macroscopic point of view. A relationship between these quantities and some conductance phenomena is pointed out. The macroscopic and microscopic views on the motion of ions in solution are compared and discussed. It is clearly shown that a macroscopic approach cannot be applied to the motion of ions on the microscopic level and can lead to senseless results. A strategy based on calculating and discussing the mentioned quantities, as well as visualization of ionic motion by an appropriate simulation, is suggested to be applied in teaching of conductivity of electrolyte solutions and transport phenomena in general.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As an introduction to quadrupolar effects in NMR spectroscopy, students use low field ( 1H, 60 MHz), benchtop  13C NMR spectroscopy to contrast the spin–spin coupling behavior of  13C to the dipolar  1H and quadrupolar 2D in familiar solvents C(H/D)Cl3, C(H/D)2Cl2, and (C(H/D)3)2CO. To explain the observations, students are introduced to the spin magnetic quantum number, I, and its use in predicting first order coupling patterns. To explain the multiplets, both the number of lines and the relative intensities, students must expand their understanding of coupling beyond the mnemonics “n + 1” and Pascal’s triangle for binomial expansion and instead utilize the nuclear spin magnetic quantum number, I, for the quadrupolar nucleus 2D. The exercise is a useful prelude to the introduction of NMR spectroscopy involving quadrupolar nuclei (e.g.,  14N (I = 1);  11B (I = 3/2)) in upper-level inorganic chemistry courses or as a fundamental description of coupling in physical chemistry courses. An advantage of the low field spectrum ( 13C, 15 MHz) is the observation of magnetic nonequivalence of the two methyl groups in (CH3)2CO in which the  13C resonance for the methyl group is readily observed as a quartet of quartets.\n\nReference\nT.

One area that bridges classroom and laboratory settings with practical hands-on learning is the use of open-source density functional theory (DFT) calculations of electronic band structures. Here, we describe to a general audience the methodology, workflow, and tutorials we have developed over five years to train student researchers. Specifically, these tutorials are for semiconductors and oxides introduced in beginner level courses which are then discussed again at various points later on in the chemistry curriculum. We provide a general overview of the background necessary to combine solid-state chemistry and electronic structure methods for instructors and DFT beginners. The remainder of the tutorial emphasizes structure–property relationships to enhance conceptual learning and make connections across the chemistry curriculum. Complete workflows for computing the electronic structure of semiconductor solids common to undergraduate and graduate chemistry curricula are presented, along with new resources for teaching computational materials chemistry. This tutorial provides multiple sets of input files and a step-by-step visualization guide to calculate band structures and projected density of states (PDOS), along with detailed descriptions that can be used to guide classroom discussions and enhance computational skills. This interdisciplinary tutorial aims to lower the barrier to entry for teachers, students, and researchers new to the field by outlining both the workflow, use, outcomes and assessments possible with freely available resources.\n\nReference\nMona Layegh, Joseph W.

    "text": "Proficiency in physical chemistry requires a broad skill set. Successful trainees often receive mentoring from senior colleagues (research advisors, postdocs, etc.). Mentoring introduces trainees to experimental design, instrumental setup, and complex data interpretation. In lab settings, trainees typically learn by customizing experimental setups, and developing new ways of analyzing data. Learning alongside experts strengthens these fundamentals, and places a focus on the clear communication of research problems. However, this level of input is not scalable, nor can it easily be shared with all researchers or students, particularly those that face socioeconomic barriers to accessing mentoring. New approaches to training will therefore progress the field of physical chemistry. Technology is disrupting and democratising scientific education and research. The emergence of free online courses and video resources enables students to learn in a style that suits them. Higher degrees of automation remove cumbersome and sometimes arbitrary technical barriers to learning new techniques, allowing one to collect high quality data quickly. Open sourcing of data and analysis tools has increased transparency, lowered barriers to access, and accelerated scientific dissemination. However, these advances also can lead to “black box” approaches to acquiring and analyzing data, where convenience replaces understanding and errors and misrepresentations become more common. The risk is a breakdown in education: if one does not understand the fundamentals of a technique or analysis, it is difficult to correctly discern the practical limits of an experiment, distinguish signal from noise, troubleshoot problems, or take full advantage of powerful analytical procedures. Our vision of the future of physical chemistry is built around democratized learning, where deep technical and analytical expertise from physical chemists is made freely available. Advancements in technical education through expert-generated educational resources and AI-based tools will enrich physical chemistry education. A holistic approach to education will prepare the physical chemists of 2050 to adapt to rapidly advancing technological tools, which accelerate the pace of research. Technical education will be enhanced by accessible open-source instrumentation and analysis procedures, which will provide instruments and analysis scripts specifically designed for education. High quality, comparable data from standardized open-source instruments will feed into accessible databases and analysis projects, providing others the opportunity to store and analyze both failed and successful experiments. The coupling of open-source education, hardware, and analysis will democratize physical chemistry while addressing risks associated with “black box” approaches.\n\nReference\nJeffrey T.

This experiment uses the clock reaction for oxidation of iodide by hydrogen peroxide to have students develop those concepts as they obtain experimental data for this reaction. In doing so, it follows initial POGIL physical chemistry activities on kinetics from the Moog and Farrell textbook.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nPre-experiment questions focus on solution preparation and review of kinetics concepts. In the first experiment cycle, students are provided with solutions and a general experimental protocol. Students then perform the protocol for several volumes of reactants without knowing what they will observe. Using their results, they develop the concepts of rates of production, consumption, and reaction. The second cycle then has students choose how to vary solution volumes so that they can measure the effect of reactant concentration on rate. They are guided to develop the concept of the rate law, applying that to this reaction. In the third cycle, students explore the temperature dependence of the reaction to determine an activation energy. Well-prepared students can complete the three cycles in two lab sessions.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\n\nSolutions of sodium thiosulfate, potassium iodide, hydrogen peroxide, starch indicator, and acetate buffer as described in the instructor handbook\nVolumetric glassware (graduated cylinders can be sufficient), Erlenmeyer flasks\nConstant-temperature water baths\n\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nInstead of obtaining data that is used to confirm chemical kinetics concepts introduced in class, students construct those concepts as they perform experiments and analyze the data. In doing so, students develop the explanation of a clock reaction based on their observations. They further show that their results conform to equations (rate law and the Arrhenius equation) that are introduced as they obtain their data. Through analysis of their data and other examples provided in the experiment, students see that these equations have broad applicability in describing chemical reaction rates.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents participate in several aspects of experimental design, particularly with respect to systematic variation of variables such as reactant concentration and temperature, interacting with each other to reach consensus on how to proceed. They share data to obtain the most complete representation of how reaction rates depend on concentration and temperature. They analyze data graphically in order to determine the rate law and activation energy, applying standard mathematical models. Students make predictions about how reaction rate changes with temperature (and are sometimes surprised how far off they are in those predictions).

In this experiment, students study the rate at which chickpeas absorb water, a system that is familiar to to any cook, but new from the perspective of how a physical chemist would study the process. Equipped with chickpeas, salt water, and a balance, students observe the regularity of the absorption rate and the effect of varying salt concentration. To model the data, students use non-linear fitting techniques that can be done in Jupyter notebooks or Excel. The experiment is an excellent and procedurally simple introduction to how physical chemists approach new phenomena.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nThe experiment consists of three cycles that can be completed in two three-hour lab periods. Students first use a basic experimental protocol and decide several aspects of the experimental design: data collection frequency, salt concentrations, reproducibility, reliable mass measurement. Through data plotting and initial rate calculation, students draw conclusions about time dependence and salt concentration effects. They then analyze the Peleg equation that describes a wide range of food absorption processes. Students revise their experiment design and perform longer runs, constructing qualitative and quantitative comparisons to the Peleg equation. In the third cycle, students connect their results to osmosis concepts, extending their understanding of the underlying models in the post-experiment questions.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\n\nChickpeas and stock NaCl solution, typically 3M\nBalances–even inexpensive ±0.1g pocket balances are sufficient to get good data\nGlassware, funnels, and other basic equipment that students can use for their experiment design\n\n\n\nWhat makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?\nThis experiment provides a simple system that illustrates how physical chemists approach new phenomena. They explore qualitatively what the system does before trying to obtain detailed data. When given an equation that is claimed to fit the data, they look at appropriate limits to address its validity before doing more complex fitting. The Peleg equation introduces the common approach of non-linear fitting, allowing students to develop a reasonable interpretation for the underlying molecular processes.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents develop hypotheses about the factors that affect water uptake by dry food. They make predictions about the effect of salt concentration, and they test those predictions both qualitatively and quantitatively. They engage in decision-making and experiment design, in running the experiment and data analysis. They share responsibility as a class for the experiment design and share data to provide a wide range of experimental conditions.

Moreover, the method is simple for undergraduate students’’apprehension, requiring only basic knowledge of combinatorial mathematics at the high-school level. Last but not least, it reduces the computational cost for complex systems, which is illustrated not only by the paradigmatic example of the \\(nd^4\\) configuration in the text but also by two other much more complicated examples of nfm and ngm.

This experiment provides a strong introduction to polymer structure for students who have had no previous experience with the topic.\n\n\nWhat do students do?\nStudents measure the viscosity of solutions of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in water using a calibrated viscometer using samples with a range of molecular weights. They use their data to determine the radius of particles in solution, and discover that the radius scales as the square root of the chain length rather than the cube root that would be expected if the particles were spherical. Students then perform a random walk analysis, first on paper and (optionally) with a computer, to discover that the size of a random walk scales as the square root of the number of steps taken. Students then analyze the appropriateness of the random walk model for polyvinyl alcohol dissolved in water.\n\n\nWhat equipment and supplies will you need?\n\nAbout one gram of each of four samples of PVA with molecular weights is sufficient to make solutions for 10-20 student teams.\nCannon-Fenske viscometers or another way of measuring viscosity.

Students are also prompted to consider how solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent interactions affect the structure of a dissolved polymer.\n\n\nAnd what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?\nStudents make predictions and develop hypotheses about the nature of polymer behavior. Students share data to have a full set of data for polymer behavior in solution. They are surprised that the data do not conform to their predictions. Students use graphical representations to analyze the data and mathematical and conceptual models to test their hypotheses about the polymer behavior.\n\n\nReference\nMichael A.

    "text": "The use of electronic formats for obtaining, recording, analyzing, and disseminating data is becoming ubiquitous in classrooms, teaching laboratories, research laboratories, and industry. The undergraduate physical chemistry teaching laboratory provides an excellent opportunity to ensure that upper-division chemistry students gain experience in using electronic means of recording and presenting the results of their experiments. To facilitate this action, computers are used in as many aspects of the course as possible: obtaining introductory material, preparing pre-lab reports, recording data in a simulated electronic lab notebook, and submitting final lab reports. Since the physical chemistry laboratory is an advanced undergraduate course, the students are also given increased responsibility for the experiment, creating their own procedure from papers, textbooks, and other additional information.\n\nReference\nJason D.
