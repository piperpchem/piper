Photochemistry is the study of the effects of light on chemistry. The fading of
a dye is due to photochemistry, and photosynthesis is one of the most important
examples of photochemistry. The absorption of light by a molecule changes the
molecule’s chemistry by altering the molecule’s geometry or rearranging its
electron density. In this experiment we will probe the photoacidity of
2-naphthol.

## Learning Objectives {#learning-objectives}


### Content Objectives {#content-objectives}

Students will

1.  distinguish between x-axis and y-axis information gleaned from a spectrum.
2.  relate a Forster cycle to corresponding UV-Vis spectra.
3.  make predictions of photoacidity based on simple structural arguments.


### Process Objectives {#process-objectives}

Students will

1.  make serial dilutions such that their data yield results within 10% of the reported value for the pKa of 2-naphthol.
2.  normalize and display spectra on the same axes.
3.  distinguish between using the x- and y-intercept of a fitted line and which
    is appropriate given experimental conditions


### Timing {#timing}

This experiment takes one or two 4-hour lab periods. Students should do the pre-
experiment questions at home before the lab period. To complete in one lab
period, the instructor likely need to make the buffers and/or hand out the
fluorescence spectra of ArOH and ArO<sup>1-</sup>.
