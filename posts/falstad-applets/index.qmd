These are some educational applets to help visualize various concepts in math, physics, [chemistry,] and engineering. They were originally written in Java, but they've mostly been converted to Javascript, so you should be able to view them without a Java-capable browser.


### Quantum Mechanics {#quantum-mechanics}

Hydrogen Atom Applet: Shows the orbitals (wave functions) of the hydrogen atom.

Molecular Orbitals Applet: Shows the orbitals (wave functions) of the hydrogen molecular ion.

1-D Quantum Mechanics Applet: Single-particle quantum mechanics states in one dimension.

1-D Quantum Crystal Applet: Periodic potentials in one dimension.

2-D Quantum Crystal Applet: Periodic potentials in two dimensions.

1-D Quantum Transitions Applet:Radiative transitions (absorption and stimulated emission) in one dimension.

Atomic Dipole Transitions Applet: Radiative transitions (absorption and stimulated emission) in atoms.

2-D Rectangular Square Well Applet:Rectangular square well (particle in a box) in two dimensions.

2-D Circular Square Well Applet: Circular square well in two dimensions.

2-D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Applet: Harmonic oscillator in two dimensions.

Quantum Rigid Rotator Applet: Particle confined to the surface of a sphere.

3-D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Applet: Harmonic oscillator in three dimensions.


### Thermodynamics {#thermodynamics}

Gas Molecules Simulation Applet: Demonstrates the kinetic theory of gases.

Heat Engine: Carnot cycle and other thermodynamic cycles.
