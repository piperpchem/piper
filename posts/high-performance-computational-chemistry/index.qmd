Computational chemistry exercises that are designed to be incorporated into an undergraduate physical chemistry course. This activity teaches computational chemistry as it is performed in higher-level research (in a command-line environment and executed on a high-performance computing cluster) to provide students with a foundation of computational chemistry skills for more advanced computational chemistry research. The activity is also a practical application of topics taught in physical chemistry courses, using the linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital (LCAO-MO) theory description of homonuclear diatomic molecules as a basis to introduce students to computational chemistry techniques, density functional theory calculations of physical observables, and the analysis of computational results. Results from a survey assessing students’ learning gains demonstrate that these exercises produce significant gains in students’ computational skills, highlighting the efficacy of this activity in achieving its primary goals.
