HITRAN is an acronym for high-resolution transmission molecular
absorption database. HITRAN is a compilation of spectroscopic parameters that a variety of
computer codes use to predict and simulate the transmission and
emission of light in the atmosphere. The database is a long-running
project started by the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories
(AFCRL) in the late 1960s in response to the need for detailed
knowledge of the infrared properties of the atmosphere. A history of
the HITRAN database has recently been summarized in the following
article:

The HITRAN compilation, and its associated database HITEMP
(high-temperature spectroscopic absorption parameters), are developed
and maintained at the Atomic and Molecular Physics Division,
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

HITRANonline provides access to the latest version of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic database.
