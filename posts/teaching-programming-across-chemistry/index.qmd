Incorporating Necessary Skills for Research and Career Success. Programming and computational science is an essential part of chemistry, yet some curricula still do not prioritize its inclusion. This work contains a collection of strategies, activities, and resources available to incorporate programming into all levels of the chemistry curriculum, with a focus on how the programming learning objectives are integrated with chemistry learning objectives. Chapters highlight best practices in software development, emphasize their importance to the future of computational molecular sciences, and describe challenges instructors might face in implementing programming in their own curriculum.
