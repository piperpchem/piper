Throughout this experiment, students should develop an understanding of the connection between an energy level in the atom and a spectroscopic line or electronic transition.\n\nStudents observe the emission spectrum using diffraction goggles, handheld diffraction gratings, filters, or rudimentary spectroscopes.
