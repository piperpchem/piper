diagram; relate energy\n    diagram lines, minima and spacing to experimental spectra and thermodynamic\n    quantities\n-   use spectroscopic methods to quantitatively determine thermodynamic parameters\n    and predict changes in spectra based on mathematical relationships\n-   become familiar with the operation of a fluorometer and temperature control\n    apparatus.\n\n\n### Process Objectives {#process-objectives}\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n-   explain the relationship between emission and excitation energies in fluorimetry.\n-   choose experimental parameters that allow determination of thermodynamic parameters from spectroscopic data.\n-   explain the relationship between spectral peaks, a pyrene monomer, and the formation of an excimer.\n-   apply mathematical models to data; use graphical methods to determine values for ΔS0 and ΔH0 by identifying the dependent and independent variables in a linear relation and relate these variables to measurable quantities in the lab.\n-   locating the desired properties from a linearized, graphed relationship using the slope and intercept.\n\n\n## Author {#author}\n\nAlison Noble, Messiah College\n\n\n##
