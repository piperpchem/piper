In general, for an organic compound a plot of the log vapor pressure
versus inverse temperature is linear over a wide temperature
range. This however can lead to a point of confusion in an
undergraduate thermodynamics course. This linear behavior is typically
explained using the Clausius/Clapeyron equation. That is, starting
with the Clapeyron equation one first assumes (1) that change in
compressibility upon vaporization is approximately 1, or equivalently
that the vapor phase may be treated as an ideal gas where the molar
volume of the vapor is much greater than that of the liquid, which may
be assumed negligible. And second (2), that the enthalpy of
vaporization is constant. While the resulting linear behavior is
captured, the underlying assumptions are not applicable over the wide
range of temperature of interest. Here we discuss the shortcomings of
the conventional explanation of the Clausius/Clapeyron equation. We
further demonstrate that a simple solution is to instead assume that
the enthalpy of vaporization relative to the change in compressibility
upon vaporization is constant. We provide a series of examples and
MATLAB code that can be used in an undergraduate thermodynamics
course.
