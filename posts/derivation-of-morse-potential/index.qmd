The Morse potential is widely used in chemistry to describe
interatomic interactions. However, there is no explicit derivation for
this empirical potential from physically meaningful atomic
quantities. We show that the Morse potential can be derived from a
simple atomic screened charge model, which accounts for the shielded
nuclear charge by the electron density and exponentially de- cays with
distance. The bond dissociation energy of a diatomic molecule is
obtained by combining the quantum mechanical covalent and classical
electrostatic interactions. The revealed connections between the
parameters of the Morse potential, the Pauling bond order and
electronegativity bridge the gap between the classical and quantum
mechanical descriptions of chemical bonds. The proposed derivation and
interpretation of the Morse potential in terms of atomic quantities
such as electron-nuclear attraction energy and orbital exponents will
be valuable in helping students to form a simple picture of chemical
bond.
