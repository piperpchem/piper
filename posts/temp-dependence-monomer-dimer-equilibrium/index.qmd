A laboratory experiment in which 1H NMR and UV−vis spectroscopies are
applied to probe the temperature dependence of a monomer−dimer
equilibrium involving a cyclopentadienone derivative is described and
discussed. Details of the data analysis for extraction of equilibrium
constants from the raw experimental data from both techniques are
provided, leading to the determination of thermodynamic parameters
(ΔrH° and ΔrS°) via van’t Hoff analysis. Fully analyzed datasets are
provided in the Supporting Information to aid adaptation of the
experiment or its use as a data analysis activity.
