A guided-inquiry approach to the classic hydrogen atom emission spectrum experiment. Throughout this experiment, students should develop an understanding of the connection between an energy level in the atom and a spectroscopic line or electronic transition.

Students observe the emission spectrum using diffraction goggles, handheld diffraction gratings, filters, or rudimentary spectroscopes. Measurements of the atomic lines can be made using a variety of spectrometers.


## Learning Objectives {#learning-objectives}

**Content Objectives**

Students will be able to:

-   develop the relationship between the electronic energy levels of an atom and its spectral lines, especially how transitions among energy levels are revealed in emission spectroscopy
-   create a quantitative diagram of the electronic energy levels for the hydrogen atom based on their analysis of the emission spectrum
-   determine the Rydberg constant as a fit parameter for the Balmer series and they will see that the same constant re-appears in the Lyman and Paschen series.

**Process Objectives**

Students will be able to

-   use data to build a graphical model that explains spectral measurements and informs choices for subsequent measurements.
-   modify and update their model throughout the experiment
-   fit the emission lines to various functions of a quantum number and justify which function is best
-   generate quantitative graphical depictions of data and use them to find patterns among different emission bands.

## Timing {#timing}

Depending on available equipment and student familiarity with the equipment, the experiment may be possible in a three-hour lab period. Alternatively, there is a natural breaking point to split the experiment across two periods.
