A simple Excel spreadsheet-based program for simulating atomic
emission spectra from the properties of neutral atoms (e.g., energies
and statistical weights of the electronic states, electronic partition
functions, transition probabilities, etc.) is described. The contents
of the spreadsheet (i.e., input parameters, formulas for calculating
emission intensities, etc.) are in full view and are controllable by
the student and instructor, and the result of changing temperature and
line width on relative intensities can be observed in real time.
Thorough descriptions of how to use the spreadsheet-based program, how
to extract relevant quantum mechanical properties from the NIST Atomic
Spectra Database, and how to create a new worksheet for an element of
interest are also included. It is envisioned that the program will
serve as a means for instructors to link atomic emission in the
visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, as in the flame test
demonstration, to the theoretical concepts of statistical and quantum
mechanics encountered in advanced physical and analytical chemistry
courses.
