This book reflects the diversity of physical chemistry experiences of the authors themselves. Some chapters provide suggestions to increase engagement by providing new, intriguing contexts such as protein interactions and surface chemistry through which to teach traditional physical chemistry concepts. Other chapters focus on pedagogy, presenting ideas on how to increase the active involvement of students in their own learning or how to help students memorize difficult thermodynamic equations. Still other chapters challenge traditional instructional notions with ideas such as using flipped classrooms and incorporating a graphic novel. In general, we organized the chapters according to these broad categories, although some chapters bridge categories.

In short, this book has a little bit of a lot of different things. However, there are twin unifying threads present throughout. First, this book was written by people interested in physical chemistry education who wanted to improve student learning in their classes. Second, this book was written for those who share our passions about teaching and learning physical chemistry.

As mentioned above, each of us has our own particular setting in which we teach our students physical chemistry. Thus, you will probably not be able to implement all the ideas from the chapters directly into your own classroom and laboratory because specific details about each author’s situation will not likely match your own. Therefore, this book is not so much a step-by-step instruction manual as it is a resource for ideas, guidance, and inspiration for improving your own physical chemistry curriculum for the purpose of engaging students.
