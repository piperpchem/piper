A spreadsheet-based exercise for students is described in which they
are challenged to explain and reproduce the disparate temperature
dependencies of the heat capacities of gaseous F$_2$ and N$_2$. For
F$_2$, C$_{p,m}$ increases from 300 K, reaches a maximum at 2200 K,
and then decreases to 74% of the maximum value at 6000 K, while C$_{p,m}$
for N$_2$ rises monotonically in this temperature range. Students compare
this behavior with the prediction of the equipartition principle and
then test four models with increasing sophistication, from closed-form
expressions of the harmonic/anharmonic oscillator–rigid/nonrigid rotor
to calculations using discrete sums over rovibrational states, all
using molecular spectroscopic constants. Fundamental principles of
statistical thermodynamics are used to calculate the partition
functions, which yield the internal energy, heat capacity, and
third-law entropy of the molecules. They encounter the need to include
the role of quasibound rotational states that arise from the
rotational barrier to molecular dissociation and to employ methods for
truncating the sums used in the partition functions. In this exercise,
students confront the fact that, for N$_2$, C$_{p,m}$ continues to rise,
reaching a maximum at 16,000 K that is 1.8 times the equipartition
value. The inclusion of electronically excited states in the partition
function is discussed.
