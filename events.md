# Past events


## Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (BCCE)

<https://bcce.divched.org/>

Jul 28–Aug 1, 2024 

<img src="https://bcce.divched.org/sites/bcce/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2022-07/BCCEhero.jpg" width="70%"/>

The Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (BCCE) is a national meeting sponsored by the Division of Chemical Education (DivCHED) of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The conference is designed for those who teach chemistry at all levels: K-12, secondary school science teachers, undergraduate students, graduate students and post-secondary chemistry faculty.

The conference provides chemistry educators with opportunities for interacting with colleagues at all levels in formal and informal settings. Instructors who are new to chemistry education and those who have years of teaching experience will find this conference to be an excellent source of materials, techniques and chemistry content.


## 27th IUPAC International Conference on Chemistry Education (ICCE2024)

<img src="https://iupac.org/wp-content/themes/iupac/dist/images/logo.png" width="30%" align="right" style="padding-left: 10px;"/>

[https://iupac.org/event/chemistry-education-icce2024/](https://iupac.org/event/chemistry-education-icce2024/)

15 Jul 2024 - 19 Jul 2024

The program is designed to discuss the role of chemistry education not only in classroom setting but also in societal context. Novel teaching and learning methods in chemistry are still the key topics in this conference. Professional development of educators at all levels (school and university) will be included. Societal context of chemistry education such as sustainability, ethics, diversity, equity, and inclusion will also be emphasized in this conference. ICCE 2024 will also include the 12th International Symposium on Microscale Chemistry.


## POGIL-PCL Hybrid Workshop

July 11, 2024

<img src="pogil-pcl.png" width="30%" align="right" style="padding-left: 10px;"/>

The POGIL-PCL team will host a hybrid zoom workshop on July 11, 12-4 pm Eastern time. We will do a new POGIL-PCL experiment, &ldquo;What is the pKa of an Acid-Base Indicator?&rdquo;, developed by Rebecca Michelsen. Each participant will do the experiment in their own laboratory - with discussions happening over zoom in real time.

To participate fully, you should have a computer with audio and video capability as well as access to Google drive. To get the most out of the experience, participants will also complete pre-experiment questions outside of the workshop time. Participants will also need to prepare stock solutions and set up spectrometers to carry out measurements during the four-hour workshop.
