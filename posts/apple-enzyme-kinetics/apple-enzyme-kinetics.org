* What is this experiment about?
Students are familiar with the browning of fruit, but they have
typically not explored the chemistry behind the process. This
experiment has students explore the kinetics of the oxidation of
catechol catalyzed by the enzyme catecholase present to different
degrees in different varieties of apples. Students engage in
experimental design allowing for parameter variation (type of apple,
pH) working with this natural system with many possible
outcomes. Instructors can optionally have students explore enzyme
inhibition.  What do students do?  Pre-experiment work has students
consider experiment design, from making solutions to extracting juice
from apples to making predictions about absorbance changes for the
catechol solution. In the first cycle, students explore the browning
reaction with and without enzyme, and in buffered and unbuffered
solutions, comparing their predictions with experimental results. They
then design an experiment (with the class) that allows application of
Michaelis-Menten kinetics and development of a quantitative answer to
the title question. These cycles can be performed in two lab periods
of three or four hour length. Instructors can use additional time to
have students complete an optional third cycle in which they develop
an enzyme inhibition experiment.
* What equipment and supplies will you need?
- Visible spectrophotometer; pH meter (or pH paper)
- Equipment for pureeing and extracting juice from apples (blender, paring knife, vacuum filtration)
- Apples! catechol; Na_{2}HPO_{4} and NaH_{2}PO_{4} for making phosphate buffer solutions; inhibitors
* What makes this experiment a physical chemistry experiment?
The study of enzyme kinetics links physical chemistry and
biochemistry. Physical chemistry is represented in both the
experimental design, particularly the investigation of multiple
factors that can affect the kinetic behavior, and in the complexity
and precision of the data analysis with an emphasis on comparing
equation linearization to non-linear fitting. The investigation of
enzyme inhibition provides a physical chemistry foundation to a
significant biochemical concept.
* And what makes it a POGIL-PCL experiment?
Students begin their work with both experiment design in considering
how to obtain the data and making predictions about how the catechol
oxidation reaction will be reflected in the absorbance data. Students
share data to see the range of apple browning behavior and interact
with other teams to do further work in experimental design. Students
process information in multiple ways in this experiment: working with
initial rates to see the range of kinetic behavior, then developing
more substantial mathematical models and graphical representations to
observe the underlying regularity and draw conclusions. The work on
inhibition is helpful for students to demonstrate their understanding
of the enzyme kinetics concepts.
