# POGIL-PCL Zoom Workshop

The POGIL-PCL team will host a moderated zoom workshop November 2 & 9, 2023, from 7pm-9pm Eastern time. We will work through the experiment, &ldquo;What can an IR spectrum tell you about a molecule?&rdquo; More details about the experiment: <https://chemistry.coe.edu/piper/posts/gas-phase-ir-pcl/>

Teams of participants will work through the experiment and have time to discuss the experiment. Moderators will do regular check-ins and be available for questions, and they will lead discussions on POGIL-PCL and facilitation.

To participate fully, you should have a computer with audio and video capability as well as access to Google drive. To get the most out of the experience, participants will also complete pre-experiment questions outside of the workshop time.

This experiment was recently highlighted in the special issue of J. Chem. Educ. last December: <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00314>
