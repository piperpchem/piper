This experiment investigates the UV-Vis absorption spectra of a series of the
conjugated cyanine dyes. Spectra contain useful information about both the
number of molecules present and the structure of the molecules. We often use
data from the y-axis of the spectrum to monitor the concentration of some
molecule as a function of time. In this experiment we will use both y-axis and
x-axis spectral data for the UV-Vis spectrum in a study of a series of cyanine
dyes.

Focus questions

Part 1: How does changing the concentration of a solution change its UV-Vis spectrum? How can Beer’s law be used to determine the concentration of the dye solution?

Part 2: How does mixing two dyes affect the UV-Vis
spectrum?

Part 3: How does molecular structure affect the UV-Vis spectrum?

## Learning objectives {#learning-objectives}


### Content Objectives {#content-objectives}

Students will

-   correctly describe that a spectrum’s y-axis relates to molecular concentration and x-axis relates to structure
-   determine molar absorptivity graphically and determine the concentration of an unknown using spectroscopy
-   apply Beer’s Law to a mixture of absorbing molecules to understand their
    independent behavior in a dilute solution
-   relate particle-in-a-box theory to spectroscopy


### Process objectives {#process-objectives}

Students will

-   model data with a linear relation
-   make solutions, including serial dilutions, using volumetric glassware and micropipettes
-   describe and interpret the data obtained from a UV-Vis spectrophotometer


## Timing {#timing}

In most cases, the full lab can be completed in two four-hour or three
three-hour lab periods.
