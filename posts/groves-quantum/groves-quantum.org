** Course Description
Thermodynamics and kinetics; properties of gases and solutions; molecular structure and energies and application to spectroscopic techniques; liquids, phase equilibria, thermodynamics of multicomponent systems with application to the life sciences. 

** Course Objectives
1. Develop an understanding of the nature of quantum systems and apply these principles to  solve the Schrödinger Equation and determine physical observables. 
2. Understand what it means for a system to be quantized and relate the quantized nature of  energy from the Schrödinger Equation to predict spectroscopic phenomena including:  electronic, vibrational, NMR, and rotational spectroscopy. 
3. Use the solutions to the Schrödinger Equation to describe how chemical bonds are formed  between atoms.
